0,Always late. Left me in a bad situation more than once. Most recently ran out of medicine and left messages with office and answering service. Over a week and no call back. Thank goodness for Aetna or I still would be without medicine. Very neglectful and have an attitude when they make a mistake. Unresponsive. Put me at risk.  Don go to him.
1,"Truly, I hate to only give Dr. Sanders one star. I don't believe he himself deserves such a low rating. But his office.... just, wow. Wow.

Roughly in July, I went to Dr. Sanders at Texas Interventional Pain Specialist for the first time. For crying out loud, he knocked my socks off. Was personable, understanding, intelligent, and compassionate. Everything I had been hoping to find in a pain doctor. At the time I was being prescribed my pain medication by my Primary Care and no one exactly knew what was wrong with me. I have like 13 different medical conditions, we know that, but what is causing all of them? What is causing all of this pain? Joints, muscles, back, nerves, bones, my very skin...everything hurt. All the time. Everywhere. Dr. Sanders empathized and said he was going to do everything he could to figure out the root problem. I damn near cried, hearing that. He told me that he didn't feel comfortable giving me medication while there were so many records of mine he didn't have and that my Primary Care should continue to do it. In the meantime, he wanted my records and referred me to see a couple of other doctors because he had some ideas. Good ideas, too. I left, very happy.

I saw the other doctors and made myself an appointment to see him again, while getting pain medication from my Primary Care. He still didn't have the records he requested and the visit was non productive. He still didn't have enough information. Okay, I understand and can work with that. He told me he would keep trying to get the records, I said I would try to get them as well, and that when he got them that he would call me. That coming in for an appointment before he got them would be pointless and to wait until he got in touch. Well, I left and requested the records be sent again. Then things started to slip. I was getting my medication elsewhere, told not to come in, and told that things were in motion. I got a new job that I loved and got very busy and just waited for Dr. Sanders to call. I'll be honest, about 3 months passed. I should have called them, should have been more on top of it, should have ect. But I didn't. I was distracted and stressed out. Things started getting flaky at work. My pain shot up and I was missing hours due to it. My Primary Care told me he couldn't help any further with the medication and that Dr. Sanders would have to take it over if something were to be done. So, with my job and ""life"" on the line, I called Dr. Sanders in January and made an appointment. I truly felt like I had everything riding on that appointment. The day of, I got a message telling me that since Dr. Sanders had not gotten any records that my appointment was unnecessary and canceled. I was not okay with this and I called back to have it put back on the schedule. This time I was told that because I hadn't seen the doctor in a few months, I was cut as a patient. And unfortunately they were not accepting new patients for the new year. So...not only did I lose my appointment...I completely had no pain doctor. I didn't say a word, just hung up. 

I'm not going to lie; I snapped. I was under an unreasonable amount of stress, I was in pain, and I felt like I was losing my job and everything else with it. That is not Dr. Sanders fault. But it was the last straw for me. To make a very long story short, I lost it, was going to kill myself, was involuntarily committed to a mental hospital, and was held there for a week.  While I did not blame Dr. Sanders for the breakdown and my mental state, I did want answers as to what the hell had happened. Believe me, I had plenty of time to think about it in the psych ward. Why was I suddenly cut off as a patient? Why did I lose a great pain doctor? Why did no one TELL me? So I called. Perfectly calm, I wound up speaking to the ""office manager"" (or something of the like) and his name was Charles. I explained what had happened. I also wanted them to know that suddenly cutting off a pain patient who is in a great deal of pain can have serious consequences. Not just mine but it could cause a LOT of problems, suddenly losing your doctor with no warning. So I asked Charles. The conversation was very disappointing. Charles kept trying to turn it around into completely my fault. ""You weren't here for three months"". Yes, but Dr. Sanders told me not to come in until he said I should. ""Technically, you were never brought into the practice. Those visits you had were just consults"". Okay...why was I not told? And why was he referring me to other doctors and ordering test like a doctor if he wasn't my doctor?  ""Your primary care was prescribing you medication and two doctors can't do that at that at the same time"". How am I supposed to know that? And why did he tell me to do it that way? And on and on. His final defense: ""Well, we see like 30 patients a day"". Yeah...not good enough."
2,After being in pain for a decade I literally walked out of this office on my way to being pain free. The entire office is filled with wonderful caring and fun folks. Their concern is getting patients feeling better!
3,"After discovering a lump in my breast, my OBGYN sent me to a breast specialist. My first couple visits with Dr, Steinhaus were pleasant considering. (Even though the first visit I was left waiting for quite some time.) I was relieved that my lump was just a cyst. Thankfully after my last visit, Dr. Steinhaus told me I was fine and to return in one year for a check up. That was October 2013. Last night my door bell rang at 7:00 at night with a certified letter. (To which was an exact copy of the two letters sitting in my mailbox that day). The letter was from Breast Care Specialists and signed by Dr. Steinhaus stating that ""They will no longer provide me medical care because I have not scheduled my follow up and/or biopsy."" Wow!! I was told to come back in Oct 2014, and that everything was fine. Additionally, they sent this letter to my OBGYN from whom I also received a call from questioning my lack of care/follow up for myself. Kudos to my OBGYN for following up to the ridiculous threat from Breast Care Specialist. But what a shame to Breast Care Specialists for not only wasting their time and money on these bullying letters, but also for wasting the time of my OBGYN to have to follow up on a bogus accusation. 

Breast Care Specialists, don't you worry.....I will not be returning to your facility for any type of care and will be sure to tell every woman I know of my experience with Breast Care Specialist. 

Disappointed in the service of medical care from Breast Care Specialist in Atlanta!"
4,"I've been going to this office for a couple of years now and have had a positive experience. I've had to go back in one for a filling that popped out right after the procedure, and they were quick to get it fixed the next day with no charges. I like that they have an email / texting reminder service. I'm about to starting taking my young children here, and we'll see how they handle that! They might just earn that final star if they survive my kids."
5,"Dr. Beisel has a telephone screener in order to pick and choose her patients based upon method of payment ( cash strongly preferred, most insurance rejected ) , even though she is listed as taking insurance from numerous companies.  $330 for 1st visit.  Read the other reviews, no sense in repeating the nightmares.  Happy Halloween."
6,"Amazing place. BETTER EMPLOYEES 

I had great service during my check up. When i received a call that my glasses were Ready for pick up, I noticed that I wouldn't get off work until after they close. One of the employees stood 35 minutes after they closed for me to pick up my glasses and said "" it is no problem, we look out for our people."" If that isn't that BEST service, I don't know what it is. Thank you Fisher Eye Associates !!"
7,"I could not be more displeased with this business. I first saw Dr. Zina (spelling?) a year ago, and she replaced the bonding on my front top tooth. She made my normal white tooth into a small brownish baby tooth that's very different than all of my other teeth. Since her first attempt had broken and I was on my third appointment for the same issue, I decided to deal with it. 

I came back today about a year later and saw Dr. Lin. He told me that I need a few fillings and adult braces. In fact he said that the brown baby tooth is my fault due to grinding my teeth, and that the only way to fix the issue is to go to an orthodontist. 

When I went to make my next appointment to fill a cavity, the woman working the front desk demands a $50 payment in advance (cash or credit only) before I am allowed to make an appointment. Really? Then she gave me the referral card to an orthodontist in Waltham. I asked for an orthodontist in Allston/Brighton or even Boston, and the genius woman actually told me that there are no orthodontists within the city of Boston. Really?!? She must have an IQ of 160. 

I asked for a manager's name and email so that I may follow up as both the prepayment for services not rendered and their referral to the Waltham orthodontist really bothered me, and she refused to give me the manager's last name  or email address. This is for ""privacy"", she said. I run an office for a living, and if someone has a complaint I take it seriously. If I ever refused to give someone my email address or last name I should not be in my position. I am going to call my insurance company tomorrow to ensure that they're not charging for procedures that I am not having done.  In fact I plan on paying $30 for X-rays and the cost of a new appointment with another dentist rather than pay them in advance. 

I would seek an appointment elsewhere. The half hour of crappy news on a flat screen is not worth it."
8,"I switched dentists because my other one was incredibly overpriced and wanted to charge me ~$600 for two fillings. 

I went here and not only was the service fantastic, the dental assistant Marion was so lovely. She was really quick, and hooked me up with
some samples and my teeth were so clean. I'm going back next week to get my cavities filled, and would you look at that it's entirely affordable and reasonably priced. 

Really lovely place. Will definitely return."
9,My doctor is pretty good. I got lucky with Dr Krienke. But.... I went in for some testing with a specialist and was charged for a procedure that I thought was covered. I disputed the charge and it went into review. I received constant bills in the mail and called the billing dept. each time. I was informed that there is no problem and to wait for the verdict from the insurance company. I got the verdict and the insurance company would not cover it. So I went to the clinic and paid in person. Now I am being harassed by a collection agency for a bill that I paid in full.  My perfect credit rating which comes in pretty handy in our culture is now suspect because of the basic incompetence of there billing dept. I would advise not using ARC. It is just not worth it.
10,"Veterans Beware!!! of this practice. . If you're going here for a C&P eval don't expect much from the NP JETT.. Nurse Practitioner.. he asked me 3 questions and walked out the exam room!!  Didn't even address the two aneurysms stroke on the right side and brain coiling, I had four years ago.. I'm already 100 percent service-connected, and he asked me if i had two strokes and an aneurysm??? I told him no you have it backwards. What a MORON Incompetent Unprofessional Rude!!!# this practice is ripping off the Department of Veterans Affairs.. should be ashamed of yourselves disrespectful. They have been reported to Washington DC Dept of VA Affairs for Abuse of Funds, and  Q&T Medical Services out of California who sets up the appointments.. what a bunch of crap.. Land of Incompetent Doctors.  HOME OF THE BRAVE.."
11,"I have a decent amount of anxiety surrounding dental visits, so I avoid them, but I had a pretty bad tooth ache and knew my teeth probably needed some work because I haven't been to a dentist in years. After a recommendation I scheduled an appointment with Dr. Silva. The receptionist was very friendly and scheduled an appointment for the next day. Everything seemed decent, but when I showed up for my appointment things went down hill fast. The office is pretty ancient looking with horribly stained carpets. I stuck around because you can't judge a book by its cover, or so I thought...

After being escorted back to one of the dental chairs the dental assistant took an x-ray of the tooth and then left with no explanation of what was going to happen next. I sat around for a while listening to other patients have their teeth worked on because the room I was in seemed connected by a partial wall to another room. Eventually Dr. Silva came in and looked at my tooth for about a minute, and then asked me what type of pain I was experiencing. At this point he spent very little time talking to me from the doorway, as if he was in a rush to end the appointment, but he still managed to make me extremely anxious and confused. 

He told me my tooth was cracked, but he couldn't see the crack so he really wouldn't know until he started working on it the outcome. He said they could try and salvage it, but then he started listing off ways they could correct the problem if it had to be removed. At this point I was pretty confused and it seemed the dental assistant was too because when he left the room for a second she asked me why I didn't want to salvage the tooth. He seemed rushed and said the receptionist will handle it from there. She then double checked that I didn't want a fake tooth and said she would just schedule me for a root canal.

The whole experience made me anxious and a little confused. Maybe this dentist is great for cleanings or people who have no anxiety surrounding dental visits, but for me one visit was enough to make me spend the day frantically searching for another dentist."
12,"I had a massage appointment booked for 4pm on Monday. I arrived 10 minutes earlier, to find the door closed, a sign that said the clinic was closed on Mondays, and a clock that displayed the time of ""we will be back at 3:15pm"". Basically, all indications that the clinic was closed. 

I waited an extra 10 minutes right in front of the clinic, and also called to see if anyone would answer the phone. Due to all of the signs that indicated the clinic was closed, I shouldn't even have waited. I did not receive a call until 4:15pm, but I was already home. I left an important meeting at work just to make this appointment on time. I have had three major eye operations back-to-back the last few months, so this was an appointment I was relying on. This was my first appointment in a long time, as I was advised by my doctor to not lay face down, so I could not book an earlier appointment. 

I was later informed that the clinic is closed on Mondays, but massage therapists still accept certain appointments. I was berated for leaving the clinic instead of waiting in front of a locked door with a closed sign on it. The owner tried to blame me and said the massage therapist had informed me that the procedures for Mondays are different, and that I was supposed to wait until someone came to get me. However, this is completely false. I was never told any of this information, and this was my first Monday appointment. I have only had two other appointments with this clinic. If I have an appointment at 4:00pm, at any other type of business, I expect my appointment will start at that time without indications of closure.   
 
I am completely shocked at the voicemail I received from the owner today. I cannot believe she told me to book my appointments with another massage therapist. What is the reason for this? Because my massage therapist was too incompetent to inform me of the correct procedures of the clinic, it is I who should get punished? I am completely appalled I was asked to pay for my ""missed"" appointment if I wanted to continue treatments with my current massage therapist. This reflects extreme unprofessionalism and makes me question the ownership of this clinic. Did I ask for lost wages because of leaving work early? Did I ask for my money back because the clinic was not open at 4pm? Who exactly makes the decisions here? How silly of me to expect the owner to take charge and find a solution when a customer has a grievance. A mistake was clearly made by the employees of Innovate Guildford, and I cannot even begin to fathom the unprofessional, inadequate, and amateur experience I have had."
13,"Garbage does not begin to describe the disrespect, and total lack of professional behavior by the nurse, doctors and support staff. I have seen this clinic run through doctors. Had a great one at first, last year, but then he left and since its been a revolving door of mean, petty incompetents who think practicing health care is some kind of god given power that they can wield with impunity. Really, in any other country, this clinic would be out of business. PMHNP Mcnulty was without a doubt the most petty, vindictive judgemental quack i have ever come across and seeing her in action makes me question whatever board allow her to practice medicine. What a mean spirited petty little weasel (i know, i've now added my own pettiness). Making judgements on patients and assuming lifestyle choices based on extremely limited contact and pulling me off my anti-depressants ive been prescribed for 2 years, with no warning, after accusing me of being a drug addict (i tested positive for 'weed' which i've got a medical card)"
14,"I am sexy!  Three words I would have never used to describe myself... until I met Julia.  She has a way of getting the sexy out of you and into that camera!  I was pretty nervous before the shoot.  But as soon as Julia opened that door and gave me a big hug, the nervousness melted away.  She is so excited to get you in front of her lens and work her magic.  Once we started, she kept telling me how beautiful I looked and how much my husband was going to LOVE the photos.  After a few frames, she gave me a peek... DAMN!  I look HOT!  After that, I just went with it.  She told me to lay here, put your hands there, stick out your butt... she definitely knows what she's doing.  Before I knew it, my time was up... but I was having so much fun!!  

I was able to sit with Julia and pick out the photos I wanted in my book.  Then she showed me one of my pics that she did some quick touch ups to, so I could get an idea of what the finished photos would look like.  Wow!!  Originally, I had planned to get a 4X6 Little Black Book.  I bumped it up to a 10X10.  (Eventually, after Julia sent me proofs of the photos we picked, I went for the 12X12 album and added extra photos!)  I figured I should go BIG!

When I picked up the finished book, I was shocked!  The book was incredible!  I was so excited to give it to my husband for Christmas.  When he opened it, all he could say was HOLY SHIT!!!  He couldn't believe I would do something like that for him.  He LOVES it!

The whole experience with Vivian's Muse was amazing.  Julia is a phenomenal photographer!  She is an artist who knows how to make women feel comfortable in their own skin... which translates into such beautiful photos.  I am so glad I decided to do this.  I would do it again in a heartbeat!  But next time, more nudes!!  ;-)"
15,"I have been going to this place for a couple months now, due to knee and lower back injuries that were caused by a car wreck a few months ago. Went to Chiro for 6+ months prior to coming here, and that only helped me with my upper back pain. No-one could heal my knee and lower back, which was having me worry that I have to live with the pain forever.

I was prescribed PT by my ortho. I honestly regret not coming here earlier. I wish I could take back all those (semi-useless) chiro sessions, especially since back then I was in grad school and SUPER busy. 

BenchMark Physical Therapy has been nothing but amazing to me. The staff are all wonderfully nice. I have yet to have an issue with any one of them. They all work as a team to make sure their clients are receiving the best treatment possible. 

The treatments that I have been receiving by my DPT (Ms. Shanoon) include stretches, strengthening exercises, walking, dry needling, and cupping. They have worked wonders, as my knee and back pain are now both gone. Ms. Shannon is an absolutely wonderful, patient, and understating person, as are and her assistants Patrick and Brandon. I am saddened by the fact that my sessions are coming to an end next week.

Overall, I think this place is superb. I recommend BenchMark at Glenridge to everyone!"
16,"This place has the worst customer service I've ever experienced and would never go back.  I made an appointment to get a prescription filled. Specifically asked if someone would be there that could write it. I arrived and no one could.
They finally mailed me my prescription, but forgot to call my insurance company to get it approved.  I've called literally 5 times over 4 days during business hours, and have never been able to talk with anyone and keep leaving messages. I have still never received a return phone call."
17,"Absolutely horrid experience there. Went in a few days ago to get a normal annual check up... took over an hour and it still wasn't completed. I wasn't seen until after 40 minutes. Kept moving me from the back of the office back to the waiting room and then back to the back of the office to another room and then another damn room. Some staff apologized for the long wait, which was nice.Needed to get blood work done and then was told they couldn't do it because I needed to fast. Well that's all fine and dandy if I WAS TOLD THIS INFORMATION prior to me getting there for my appointment. Asked the nurse why this information wasn't shared to me and he shrugged his shoulders like a 12 year old. At this point I was over it. Rescheduled for another day but The staff seemed like they could care less that they are there and they don't care about your time. Quickly cancelled the appointment with a very unprofessional woman over the phone as well. Such a shame. Now back to search for another damn doctor."
18,"Not only did I have to contact the company to get a replacement code for the non-working Groupon code, but they then lost the shipment. 

I received a tracking number and well over the estimated delivery the product still had not arrived. Same shady issue as the other Yelper where the Customer Service number reroutes to another contact. The incredibly rude Customer Service Rep, who is also listed as CAO of the company (scary!), told me that I had to wait an additional week before they could even process the replacement. 

The order had been placed well in advance of the holidays (almost a month) to accommodate a possible shipping delay as was mentioned in a Yelp response by the company owner Kiril to another dissatisfied customer; regardless, this is unlikely as my girlfriend ordered a wallet days after me and had received hers to the same household within 1 week of ordering. The owner himself then reached out to acknowledge the issue and agreed to ship the product overnight. I received tracking information yesterday, now more than a week after being guaranteed overnight shipping, that states that the product shipped on January 2 and that it is on the truck for delivery today; the product was not delivered yet again. 

Over a month and I still haven't received my wallet, yet they received payment. Next step is to contact Groupon as well as my credit card company to dispute the charges as the product was never received; a Better Business Bureau complaint will only placate me for the time being as they are scarily unaffiliated. I caution all not to buy from this company. You would get even just peace of mind from donating your money rather than the frustration of dealing with Big Skinny. Avoid!"
19,"I was referred to Dr. Denes by my primary care provider. I saw him for the first time in October of 2017 to discuss surgical options for the extreme amount of damage done to my knee due to my aggressive inflammatory arthritis. Dr. Denes was uncaring and dismissive. He told me my pain wasn't that bad and a knee replacement wasn't an option due to my age. (I'm 29.)

A year and a half later, I was told to revisit surgical options by my rheumatologist so I went back to Dr. Denes. I was told much the same thing, except this time I had built up hope that there was a solution, so I started crying in the room. Sobbing, really. I was not offered a tissue, there was no acknowledgement of my distress, nothing. He told me to look into pain management and that a knee replacement would only last me 10 years at most so it wasn't a viable option. I left in extreme distress and tried to go about my life knowing that excruciating pain was just my life and I had to accept it. 

Two days after my appointment I received an phone call from someone in the office telling me that I should contact OHSU orthopedics. I now am scheduled for a full knee replacement in June with a doctor that says she's heard nothing but bad things about this clinic and that Dr. Denes was, and I quote, ""full of ****"" and my new knee will last me at least 20 years. I am finally getting my life back after seeing a doctor who cares. She also brought my case to the ""knee board"" and all of the relevant specialists at OHSU agreed that I was a candidate for the replacement.

Don't go here."
20,"First off I was born here (1983) so automatically this makes this hospital awesome! 

I have been here a couple of times..... luckily none of them have been for myself, always visiting. 2 illnesses  1 baby! 

The last time I was here visiting my grandfather. No worries... G-pa is kicking ass! I went in the main entrance to visit him, went up to the counter to find out where he was... The person could tell I was completely lost and had no idea how to get there. She left the counter (because there was another person working the counter as well ) and walked me all the way to his room. Talk about customer service. 

The only reason it gets 4 and not 5 stars is because the hospital seem pretty old. The Drs. are still pretty awesome!"
21,"I noticed their new patient deal for cleaning and x rays, so I made an appointment. Making an appointment was easy to do online and they confirmed via email and phone. Everyone was super nice and and helpful but it was the LONGEST cleaning appointment ever. I was in the office for over two hours, I think this was in large part due to the fact that I don't have dental insurance, so after the cleaning was over I had to wait for the financial guy to come in and try to sell me discount plans and credit cards. I did make an appointment to get my wisdom teeth out. When I went in for the procedure I signed in and paid and then I waited for over an hour (with no food in my stomach!) everything with my wisdom teeth went fine, but I was shocked two months later when I received a letter from a collection agency stating that I had not paid Boulder Modern dentistry. I never received a bill from BMD and as far as I knew, I paid in full before having my wisdom teeth out.  When I called BMD to check in on this collections letter I was told it was a mistake. No apology, no concern."
22,"Horrible service all three times I've gone. The lens crafters store in the mall is horrible unfriendly and highly unprofessional service. Think twice before letting yourself go to this lens crafters. The guys at Macy's on the other hand. PHENOMENAL. Don't go to the store unless you wanna be disrespected with poor customer service. I tried going and the lady got mad so I resorted to the one in Macy's where I was treated very kindly. The guys at Macy's are a 10/10. The lady's at the store were all very unfriendly. Had to get the lenses fixed and needed them fixed soon so had to go to the actual store so that I could get them fixed quicker. I called probably 4 times trying to see the hours of the optician and the entire time they told me not to worry. Called before I headed over there as well then when I got there he was on break for the next hour. Eventually got them dropped off. Wish they had same day fixed at the LensCrafters inside Macy's. Afterwards when I went to go pick up the glasses the lady at the store kept having to make snarky comments as she fixed my glasses to fit my face. Might I add the guys at Macy's were kind enough to wipe their finger prints off my glasses after they fit them on my face. The lady at the store was even frustrated to fix my glasses that were crooked and my glasses were covered in finger prints. Moral of the story, go to Macy's for great service with glasses or if you want poor service you can resort for the store. PS, Richard from Macy's even called me days later to see how I was adjusting to my glasses!!! GO TO MACYS LENSCRAFTERS."
23,"RON Miller is the BEST!!

On the 21st of September, 2016, I was diagnosed with severe inflammation of my left shoulder. It was extremely painful and hot to the touch. I was put on strong pain killers, anti-inflammatory meds & muscle relaxants. I was advised to rest my arms & shoulder, and avoid moving them for 2 weeks minimum.
 I was also advised to avoid sleeping on my left side. 

For a person that went to the gym 3-4 times a week, I felt so handicapped.  A month later, I was much better, but I was unable to move my arm or shoulder without triggering much pain. That is when my mom mentioned The Pursuit Center for me. She had gone for therapy there 2 years ago, herself, after breaking her little toe. She had so much pain walking after removing her cast, but, after her treatment at The Pursuit Center, with Ron Miller's, she was pain free within a month!

I couldn't wait to start treatment. I didn't want to remain in pain!

At the Center, Ron, checked my arm & my rotation abilities. He was able to discover where the source of my pain was; (TOS).
I was happy to know that it was treatable and I immediately started my treatment. I felt 20% better after my 1st treatment was over.
In less than 3 weeks later, I was almost pain free &  could move my arm and shoulder again! 
I was told I could resume my gym workouts (with certain precautions).
Ron Miller was able to bring my shoulder back to it's normal ability and diminish my shoulder pain in less time than anticipated. All his treatments were painless. In fact, I always left with less pain than when the treatment started.
 I am very happy I saw him when I did!
 I got my life back to normal in less than 4 weeks.
Ron is really knowledgeable in his field and, equally important to me, was his encouragement & optimism. 
I highly recommend his services to anyone who developes pain regardless of it's cause.
I am confident you will never regret it!"
24,"Had to go in for surgery on my arm after falling and breaking a couple bones. I had Dr. Hoffman for my surgery. She was super super nice and she was very helpful. Explained everything well, took time to make sure I understood everything and genuinely cared. This review IS NOT for her. 

This review is for the the ""nurses"" that manned the prep room for surgery. It was at the South Building of Tufts. The rudest nurse I've ever met was apparently the head nurse. Her name was Ellen (or was is Ellie or something like that). Curt, rude and gossiped the whole time I was there. The other nurses weren't bad per se, but they were all gossiping and I didn't see any smiles while there. They made the place gloomy and kinda hostile. 

Long story short, ""nurse"" Ellen is rude and made my experience at Tuft's TERRIBLE. I liked Dr. Hoffman and recommends her!"
25,"So I have to update my review. Over the last year, staff has overturned and while its good to have more providers, some of the staff are less than polite and patient. Furthermore, we're being charged a fee for any cancellation within 24hrs-- YET... EVEN WHEN YOU CONE TO YOUR APPT ON TIME, AT LEAST IN MY CASE- IVE ALWAYS HAD TO WAIT 45++ min TO BE SEEN!! THE CANCELLATION FEE ISNT APPLIED TO US FOR NOT RESPECTING OUR TIME! WE ARE TO RESPECT THEIR TIME- BUT THE OFFICE CAN DO AS THEY WISH WITH OURS?  I'm busy too! And my husbands line of work certainly can't accommodate these waits. I've already changed docs for him because he can't waste 90+ min of his day "" waiting"" to he seen........ I feel Dr Sneed is a great doctor but the daily mechanics off the office need a lot of work! Sorry ..... it's the truth. All our time is valuable!

My old 5star review:

Just moved to the area and my son got sick they were able to squeeze us in as a new patient the same day! Dr. Dale was very attentive, thorough and engaged with both my son and I... Happy to have found our new doctor! Coming from a military treatment facility where you feel as though seeing a doctor is like a cattle call .... This was a very refreshing experience thank you. I also like that he wasn't eager to prescribe antibiotics... But rather really tend to just the issue at hand ... I believe I'm holistic and natural medical remedies as much as possible .... So this works ...."

THE CANCELLATION FEE ISNT APPLIED TO US FOR NOT RESPECTING OUR TIME! WE ARE TO RESPECT THEIR TIME- BUT THE OFFICE CAN DO AS THEY WISH WITH OURS?  I'm busy too! And my husbands line of work certainly can't accommodate these waits. I've already changed docs for him because he can't waste 90+ min of his day "" waiting"" to he seen........ I feel Dr Sneed is a great doctor but the daily mechanics off the office need a lot of work! Sorry ..... it's the truth. All our time is valuable!!!!

My old 5star review:

Just moved to the area and my son got sick they were able to squeeze us in as a new patient the same day! Dr. Dale was very attentive, thorough and engaged with both my son and I... Happy to have found our new doctor! Coming from a military treatment facility where you feel as though seeing a doctor is like a cattle call .... This was a very refreshing experience thank you. I also like that he wasn't eager to prescribe antibiotics... But rather really tend to just the issue at hand ... I believe I'm holistic and natural medical remedies as much as possible .... So this works ...."
27,"Caution: May Case Miracles. I started seeing Dr. Denaro when her office first opened, for a few different ailments at different times. Each time, to my surprise and in less visits than anticipated, I experienced immediate results improving in my pain. Conditions cured by Dr. Denaro include knee problems preventing me from my normal running routine (turned out my hips and lower back were twisted and out of alignment), severe pinched nerves in my neck restricting my range of motion, tendinitis symptoms in my arm, severe migraines and even head colds (chiropractic can actually fix this!) Besides her expertise in the field, her gentle demeanor, warm and authentic personality, and genuine interest in my health and well being makes Dr. Denaro a doctor I will always come to and recommend to anyone. She's a miracle worker- see for yourself!"
28,"Prior to my experience with Dr. Suholet, I was with a wonderful Dr. for 12 years until his retirement. Dr. Suholet was recommended to me by that same Dr. In all of my years in dealing with the Medical field from receptionists to Surgeons I have never had an experience quite like this one. Upon my first visit Suholet spent fifteen minutes asking me questions from a standard list he read from. In that short frame of time He diagnosed me with a possibility of serious problems in the future. As he got up he stated that he was hesitant to take me on but he would and I would have to be monitored. I was in such shock, I didn't quite know what to say so I left wondering how he could have done that. As I said earlier I was with the same Dr. for 12 years and nothing of this nature came up. I'm very basic in my prescriptions, a mild one for depression and another for sleeping disorders. This visit was $170.00. A month goes by and I do not have my prescriptions filled, so I call and they tell me another appt. is necessary. I walk in and he starts on about a history book he read and before I could say anything he hands me my prescriptions. I did not notice what he had done until I got to the pharmacists. He had cut my regular prescription down to a third with no explanation. I called that day and he said it's all I needed and would decide later on if I required more. That visit was $75.00. That's when I decided to get a second opinion, when I called the office to see another Dr. in the same practice the receptionist tried without success to explain the policy. When I asked for clarification, she called me an a****** and hung up. I called back and spoke with the Office Manager and all she did was defend the lady who used such language and telling me she was having a bad day. I have since found another Dr. and after a visit of more than hour, he stated that he would fill my prescriptions as required and I went on my way. Dr. Suholet and his staff are unprofessional, rude, and lacking in knowledge and basic business principals. My suggestion is to avoid this Dr. at all costs and to find someone that at least can fake listening. Stay away, you will be glad you did."
29,"Found my dentist in Austin.  Everyone was super nice, Dr Sehmi & her assistant were great explaining my two implants done in another state.  Ashley helped me with what my insurance covered. Julie was awesome today in my cleaning. Thanks, see you soon!"
30,I couldn't wait to write this review! I'm trying to remember if I'm rating a dental office or a spa! What a fantastic experience from start to finish. The hygienist told me what was happening every step of the way and didn't once shame me on not flossing as much as I should!! I'm going back to get more work done and I'm actually looking forward to it!! Thank you Dr Katie and all the staff. See you soon!
31,"First of all I have to say I get MAJOR anxiety attacks going to the dentist. My significant partner told me I should try Gentle Dental. When I arrived I was so worked up. I needed to get an full check up. When I met Dr. Rayav, I thought he was nice. He could tell that I was anxious. He was so kind. He kept asking if I was ok, and if I felt any pain. I was so impressed by him. I have a phobia about going to the dentist which lead me to need some work done. I was really embarrassed. Dr. Rayev was so kind. He didn't judge me at all. He told me what needed to be done first so I wouldn't lose my tooth. I never thought I would be able to handle getting an implant, but I did Thanks to Dr. Rayev.  I really hope he reads this because he deserves to be recognized for the great dentist he is!!! Thank you DR. Rayev........see you soon!!!"
32,"I come here for several different things and have seen several Dr's and RN's for treatments of various sorts.  I absolutely love the location, the team, the facility and the customer service that they deliver.  It's top notch in every way.  I have referred dozens of people here for everything from mole/skin checks, tattoo removal, Botox/fillers,  plastic surgerie and acne.  100% satisfied every time.  Thank you and see you soon!"
33,"Lots of good dentists here!  
I hope to be enabled to get a temporary tooth for some missing tooth parts once the office is open and there is a dentist available.
I can continue with your help to take care of my healthful personality and upward looks.  It's so good for the overall health!
See you soon!"
34,"Taylor and Hillary make a dynamic duo team!!! I can't say enough wonderful things about this practice. Honestly, the sweetest admin staff ever, for a doctors office. They actually make eye contact with you and talk to you, and are friendly! And, then you get to the doctors! Awesome, all of you! Taylor rocks! She always talks me down off any type of crazy emotional train I've jumped on. This past year I needed some light cosmetic work done and I was introduced to the group on the cosmetic and aesthetic services side. Hello Hillary, and hello to my new BFF! They can do ANYTHING over there, I'm kinda hooked! Laser hair removal, ahhhhhhhmazing facials, little skin tightening here and there. I don't care what kind of issue you have, when you meet Hillary, you are meeting a friend. And she will listen to you with respect, and will treat you with such amazing care. You guys have an awesome thing going there! Glad I found you all! See you soon!!!"
35,"Dr Casmedes is the best doc I've ever met in my life. He's caring, understanding, and really explains the complicated stuff in a simple way. 
Thanks again and I'll see you soon!"
36,"I had an extraction/bone graft performed here. So far so good. Dr Brandon was very easy going but professional as you'd want someone to be who's working in your mouth. I heard him firmly tell at assistant that the tool they brought was substandard for some reason I couldn't understand, so I got the feeling he runs a tight ship, also something I appreciate in a dentist. The staff were pleasant enough and prices seemed fair (very similar to other places I'd gotten quotes from). I love the bucket of chocolates at the front desk, as if to say, ""See you soon!"""
37,"I decided to go to the dentist after five years of hardcore procrastination.  It's difficult to be vulnerable, trapped in a chair with your mouth stuck open but Dr. Kaady and his hygienist were so nice, so helpful and nothing hurt.  The entire experience was easy breezy.  I have two cavities because of my ice cream addiction but I'm not afraid of my upcoming appointment to fix them, I'm kind of looking forward to it.  Dr. Kaady let me ask my questions and was thorough and thoughtful with his answers as were his staff.  I tend to babble and they were gracious to listen  and humor me.  I was explained my X-ray; shown my receding gum-line and my cavities.  The hygienist cleaned my teeth thoroughly and gently, even flossed them, which is something I've never really done myself.  They gave me free floss!  My teeth feel so good now and I've been brushing them constantly to keep them feeling good.  I won't be afraid to visit the dentist anymore.  Every year from now on.  Thank you Bridgetown Dental, see you soon!"
38,"This place is great! The dentist and staff really know what they are doing. They are gental, kind and sociable. I hate going to the dentist as well (I dont think anyone does) but here they always make sure I am comfortable. Unlike other places they do not nickle and dime you here. 

Yeah, the prices may be $20-$40 higher than most but the work preformed is worth it. I used to get my teeth fixed for dirt cheap prices and as a result I had to get them re-fixed... 

Keep up the good work and I will see you soon!"
39,"Do not go here if you have high expectations 

Northstar canceled my appointment after sending me this confirmation the day before:
A reminder from Northstar Family Dental Westerville that Xxxxxx has an appt at 1:30 PM. See you soon! 614-891-4242, STOP=EndMsgs
So they confirmed my appointment and also canceled it? Crazy. Also, they failed to send a cancellation. Definitely sub standard customer service. Stay away!!!!"
40,"Just spent $40 getting myself downtown to this place and I didn't even get seen during my appointment time. ""You're booked for your SmileShop visit on Sat 05/12 at 04:30 PM! We waived the credit card requirement for you - appt. is free. See you soon! -SmileDirectClub"" ... safe to assume that one would actually have an appointment set up? Apparently not. They didn't tell me they accidentally double booked for the appointment and just let me wait for nothing."
41,"Dr. Pinero was the highest level of professionalism I've ever received from a doctor.   My experience, start to finish was great!  Im scared of doctors, but Dr. Pinero made me feel extremely comfortable. His knowledge of medicine and health was impressive.  His co-workers and nurses were organized and friendly.  I had no wait time for my appointment and it happened at the time I made it for.  They have mastered the art of medicine and customer service because I received the best of both.   I finally have a doctor I trust.  Im a teacher so if this was a test:   Dr. Pinero received am A++.  I feel very safe in my life now that I found Dr. Pinero and his coworkers and nurses.  Thanks guys! See you soon!"
42,"OKAY!!! I needed to write this review looooooong time ago but life happens... However good service never goes unnoticed. Highest recommendation for Dr. Ian McLaughlin and his team at the McLaughlin Family Dentist

I live 1.5 miles away from his dental office. Yes, I know I am the lucky one!!  The way he treat his patients makes me want to stop by every morning to say hello. I wish I could. Dr. Ian is not only a great dentist, but he is also very funny. His staff is amazing also. Very friendly and professional. They create a very hospitable environment. 

They have a very clean and up to date facility with an in-house panoramic x-ray.  Scheduling an appointment is a breeze!! Linda is amazing!! his very friendly team ensuring you get your reminders also put you on waiting list and call if there are any openings. 

Dr. Ian always greets with a friendly smile every time you walk in the clinic. He takes an interest in your life outside of the office. He takes his professionalism seriously and will provide you his best recommendations. With any procedure you take on, his goal is to make it as comfortable and painless as possible. He takes pride in what he does. Very meticulous, and a perfectionist!!

I have gotten so much work done over the years at Dr. Ian's office. My most recent work was on veneers for my 8 front teeth. I am originally from an East-European country (not UK). Us Europeans are known for our soft enamel. I went to see Dr. Ian and  I was joking around about getting a Hollywood smile. At first, he did not think I was serious (and trust me every other dentist not only agree with you on the work you need but would crank up that bill). He sent me home with few flyers and said think about this and we dont need to decide today. I was so comfortable and felt very supported on my decision. I got veneers!!!! Dr. Ian took his time to give me a perfect smile. He was very careful and worked for hours to create that perfect smile. He helped me with the shade of my new teeth and made other suggestions that helped me be confident on my smile. 

This would be my first major dental procedure and I was a bit afraid but Dr. Ian made me feel like I was in for just a cleaning. The day came and my procedure ended with a breeze. My favorite part about it was the conversations we were having (mostly him talking and me agreeing by nodding), the fact that he took my pain seriously, stopping immediately to provide me with more numbing as necessary or resting my jaw was major!!

It is funny to me when people say they dont like their dentist or cringe at the idea that they have to go see a dentist. I love mine!! He is the best. 

Again, I want to thank your friendly staff for accommodating my needs and always taking good care of me.
You Rock!! See you soon!"
43,"I hate the dentist. I had a very traumatic experience as a 15 year old girl, and have been terrified ever since. It seems only emergencies are what gets me in the chair, usually for root canals or extractions. The feeling of being scared magnifies when I become embarrassed that I let my teeth get so bad that, THEY DO need emergency care. Ugh. As you read, please keep in mind, the pain, terror, and tears this type of doctors appointment brings me, just like you, maybe? I want this to help other fellows with major dental fears!  

Customer Service:
I wanted to give THE LOCATION 5 stars, bc it was a EXCELLENT experience with the front desk, assistants, and Dentist. HOWEVER, the reason for losing some good marks, is the same as what I have read from other online reviews, and NOT just listed on Yelp. BJ and ESPECIALLY Sherry are the reason I almost did not continue with my treatment here. I have never been talked down to and treated the way I was than when I spoke with her over the phone. When a friend called back for me, I was upset and in so much pain, she hung up with her jaw dropped, saying she couldn't believe Sherry and her rudeness. Expect to be interrupted, talked down to, talked to like a infant, and her belittling backhanded comments about WHY I was having tooth pain. ugh. See above embarrassment issue right?! THANK goodness, she is just a lame voice on the phone and NOT ANYONE important in the dental office.  Please keep that in mind. Her bad attitude reflects on how she feels about herself, not us.

Location:  
Ok. So. The location was convenient, just off Sunnyside and 205. I missed a turn on my way out and having to go all the way up to 122nd and U turn was a bit of a challenge, but not awful. However, pay attention! Once to the location, signs show me to park on a bit of a lower ""level"" parking lot. Its a small lot, but there was 1 spot left, just for me! Goodie. *gulp*  When I walked up, I saw this location housed more than 3 businesses (I don't remember what... LMT and maybe insurance...?) The door opens to the smallest lobby I've ever seen, to the left is the LMT and then a LONG staircase up, and the Soft Touch Dental door, directly in front of me to the right. Shit. Ok. I have to walk in. Ok. Walking in ...   Super small waiting area. Smells great, clean, modern chairs and a tree. Lots of sports illustrated and a better homes and garden. No radio. No tv. I can hear the drills, spits, water piks, and mumbled answers from the peeps in the chair. No one is screaming. No crying. No EMS. I'm feeling ok. Shaking like a leaf, I walk up and am helped by 2 of the NICEST receptionists ever! (I will get their names on Friday and update ;)) They didn't blink an eye when I mentioned I was with Moda/OHP/Family Care aka bottom of the bottom feeders of Cover Oregon. She smiled and said, ""We're so glad we're here to help you and get you out of pain."" I started crying. I felt a peace and calmness for the first time in about 6 weeks, as I had been searching for a dentist that WOULD take my insurance. I filled out my paperwork, easy peasy.  I waited about 20mins. ugh.  I hate the dentist. How do they do this ALL DAY LONG.  In the words of Sara from Jimmy Fallon, EW!  

Dental Hygienist:
Cookie! :D  I'm a pastry chef and the irony that my Universe brought me a assistant name, Cookie was a instant smile! She noticed right away I was feeling uneasy, shaking, and now the sweats had started. Her vivacious curls and welcoming smile made me feel like we had known each other FOR YEARS! I started to apologize to Cookie, as if SHE were my jawline, bone tissue, or damaged tooth. I cried and said, ""I'm so sorry.""  She gently put her hand on my shoulder, looked me in the eyes, and said, ""It's ok. We all make mistakes. Now, lets get this taken care of!"" 
*Im crying right now, as I type and relive this moment... it was very touching*
Cookie was gentle with the xray, listened to me and LET ME BE ME! She didn't rush me, or get frustrated when she had to work for a few extra minutes to get the xray slide into a comfortable position in my mouth. She didn't tell me what I should have or could have done, she accepted me and my bunk ass tooth. She left, gave me a air high five and said, ""I look forward to SEEING YOU SOON!"" I laughed nervously, because my past says, yea, Im only here for emergencies, however, I meant it when I said to her, ""YES, I WILL see you SOON Cookie! Thank YOU!"" 

The Dentist: 
Dr. Sarah Mazareei joined me chair side within a matter of minutes. She introduced herself in a very gentle, soft, and caring voice. I told her my stress & history with dentists, and confided in her I was SO ready to be over the fear. She said she would help with that, and I believed her. :)  She didn't have to do much at this visit, just diagnose me. Its a root canal or extraction. Go figure. Sigh. I have decided to get the extraction and that will be at the NE 13th location. Review to follow. 

Thank you Sunnyside peeps! See you SOON! :)"
44,"We also enjoy coming here as they have some stores that are not available in our area like Barnes and Noble, Box Lunch, Think Geek....and so much more. 

We finally rented those stuffed animal carts and the kids had a blast cruising around the mall! They even gave a extra time as we requested more time! 

One of my son's also discovered a great store with statues and other interesting decor. We can't wait to go back as it has been a few months! 

They also have some great choices for food. See you soon!"
45,"I am editing this review due to the amazing response from my piercer, Gary. Integrity, humility and exceptional customer service is a rarity nowadays and I am always super grateful when I encounter it in a professional and in a business. Thank you to Gary and to Adorn for excellence in client service and quality. I will be back and will continue to refer my friends to both Adorn and to Gary. Thank you so much. See you soon!"
46,"Hands down - Amanda - not only does she make you feel relaxed and creates a comfortable atmosphere, she also knows so much more than just massage therapy - she gets it and is well worth the money. Please don't go anywhere Amanda - I will be back to see you soon!"
47,"Whoa, talk about awful customer service.
I loved this place and raved to co workers, fam, and friends.

YOU know that feeling you get when you leave the dentist? the one that reflects a cleaning. you rub your tongue along your teeth and tell everyone that you can feel each individual tooth perfectly. they floss them. they polish them. 
Well apparently Meadows dental DOESN'T
AND if you say it was poorly done they wont believe you. you can even ask to come in to show them. they wont see you. so dont expect the clean feeling when leaving their office. dont expect some one to care about it either.

the new staff members are awful and lack basic dental skills.
I went in and was told i needed 5 cavities (last yr i only needed 2 refills on my current cavities. suspicious. different staff back then) I was also told i needed 2 cleaning this year.
one at the time of the visit and the other in 6 months. (never needed that before either. suspicious.)

i told the doctor and the poorly skilled dental hygienist that since i needed 5 cavities I would come in for the 2cd cleaning and fillings on the same day. about 2-4wks after my cleaning.

CLEANING? WHAT CLEANING?
I was very disappointed in the so called cleaning and decided to speak to management
the next day. i talked to the ""office manager"" and explained that not only did she not floss, get the gunk between the teeth, or polish them she also managed to get the cleaning tool STUCK BETWEEN MY TEETH (bottom front 2 teeth. THE only spot she actually cleaned. by accident) I said she continued to force the tools between my teeth. YES i grunted and squinted my eyes in pain. she then rinsed my mouth and said SEE YOU SOON!
I told the manager that my teeth look and feel the same. except now my 2 front teeth are sore and sensitive. i told her that it felt like she just sprayed water in my mouth and called it a day. 
I suggested she got nervous. maybe scared so stopped the real cleaning. 
they didn't care what i had to say. or ask to show.

My insurance was charged for this ""cleaning"" and now when i return for my fillings and the 2cd cleaning i would need to pay out of pocket.

so I expressed my concerns on paying for the 2cd visit since the first visit was poorly done and my teeth don't have that clean feeling. 
the manager said she had to ask the doctor. Dr.Patel.
they decided (After speaking the hygienist) that the cleaning was done the way they expected it to be done. They seriously need cameras in the room. I was shocked! So I offered to come in and have all 3 (The mgr, the doctor, and the hygienist) look at my teeth and tell me if its properly cleaned. They declined. 

So basically im left with a dirty mouth. My 1 free annual cleaning WASTED on this office. Me, my husband, our friends, and our family will be going somewhere else! THANK GOD FOR YELP! 
really missing the old staff right about now. :/"
48,"I use the Orlando Va  because I have to. My Dr. ( I won't give her name) is hateful, dyslexic,and rude! Cultural difference my foot, be compassionate and understanding as well as polite! Don't blame me when you order an MRI on the left foot when it is the right foot, which you said wasn't broken if I could walk on it and it WAS broken! So an MRI on both feet because you couldn't admit you were wrong!?
Calling me, asking me about my problem, then hanging up on me while I am answering you! Yes, you are representative of how this country treats not only vets, but human beings! 
It is Not your right to judge, only to listen , Give  advice, and heal or manage illness and injury. 
You thinking you are better, smarter, and or worth more than a vet, or any human being makes you worth far less, remember your training,,( American training) empathy!!!!!!!!!"
49,"Skincare Physicians provides the highest level of dermatology services in the area (and beyond). 

My personal journey with Skincare Physicians began when I was in my late teens/early twenties. I was under the care of Dr. Sobbell, who helped me clear my acne issue. I had been put on several medications prior to seeing Dr. Sobbell, all which seemed to work temporarily, but with no long term success. After great frustration my Mom directed me to this practice, where Dr. Sobbell recommended a miracle drug (spironolactone) which cleared my acne for good ! As you can imagine this did wonders for my self esteem. No other doctor at any other practice had been able to do this.

I am now in my mid forties, and although my acne issues have resolved, I am now in need of other dermatology care. I am currently a patient of Dr. Karen Kim. She has worked with me to address all of my needs associated with ageing and beyond- Laser hair removal, laser to improve my melasma (hyperpigmentation), botox, and fillers. She is kind, professional, and most of all patient. I am the kind of person who is interested in understanding all things skin care. I do a lot of research, but admittedly I am left with many questions. I am always asking Dr. Kim the ""how"" and ""why"" of things, and she always takes time to explain things to me. This  makes me feel that I am really being cared for. Also, for those considering botox and/or fillers, I can assure you that Dr. Kim's ""hand"" is extremely gentle. Fear not- a very light prick of a needle is all you will feel with her. I am now leaning on Dr. Kim to let me know when it's time for other procedures to keep me looking my best- but she does not ""hard sell"" me on anything. She has only ever offered her expertise to help keep me looking as NATURAL and youthful as possible. All of the doctors at this practice are beyond competent (you can look into their numerous accolades), but Dr. Kim is my go to girl!"
50,"I don't know how to even get a hold of someone at Texas Longhorn Pediatrics anymore, all their communication channels are taken over my Texas Children's Pediatrics. I use to LOVE our LHP family - McMains and Erin and the staff are awesome (still are, the one star is literally for TCP). Everyone in the office was caring, kind, patient with new mommas and experienced mommas. It was simple, easy to get a hold of people - we knew the staff. It felt friendly and not like a cookie cutter chain. 

Then Texas Children's Pediatrics came along and took over and there were some growing and learning curves that made my husband want to go somewhere else - like waiting NEARLY 4 HOURS for an appointment one day, 1.5 in the waiting room and 2.5 in a room?! The excuse was they were setting up the new technology that day, things were behind, everyone was apologetic and very nice. I was able to look over that experience and move on because I LOVE the staff and how they seemed to care so much about our kids and were so responsive. 

Unfortunately, it has continued to get worse. I am not a jump up and run to the Dr mom, but when we need to go we need to go and I have always gotten in the same day if its something that might be urgent. I called first thing this morning when they opened had to keep calling and calling and calling for nearly 20 minutes to get a real person because the answering service was still turned on. Finally got someone told them that Teddy has been running a fever for the last three days and I needed to get him in - she offered me an appointment tomorrow or to go to urgent care. I told her I was really concerned about the cough and he has asthma and asked her where else to go. She gave me some urgent care recommendations and I was then told good luck and she moved on to the next call I assume. She never even asked how high his fever was, what else was going on ... nothing. I am familiar enough with this process to know that his fever wasn't life threatening but what if it was? What if some momma calls and waits till the next day because she didn't know? What you guys did today was just not ok. 

I was able to get him in with another pedi that we went to for an after-hours clinic one-weekend last year when he was sick. They got us in today and helped. I will be looking for a new office that has the same feel LHP use to have before Texas Pedi took over and I will be sharing my experience. Today wasn't the end of the world for me it was the straw that broke it for me though. We will miss Texas Longhorn Pediatrics and Dr. Mcmain so much. Thank you for taking good care of our baby bear the first couple of years. I wish you the best of luck with the mess that TCP is creating."
51,"I would give zero stars if I can. 

I would not recommend anyone to go to Brooke Radiology for prenatal ultrasound. I went on my 20th week for my ultrasound appointment. I do not care for fancy offices, magazines or updated equipment. I care for reliable reports from radiologist to tell me how my baby was doing. I did NOT get that for sure. I understand that it may be difficult at times to get good views of everything, but that should be noted on the report as something that they can not conclude on and request for me to come in for a follow up appointment. 

Here is my personal experience:
I went in for my ultrasound and the technician seems to have difficulties getting some images. For a good 20 minutes or so, he was making frustrating sounds like sighing and ""tsk"" and asking me to turn to my right or left multiple times. Then he told me to go use the bathroom and walk around, hoping baby will turn around. When I went back in, he mentioned that baby was still in the same position, so I need to go back. He did not tell me why until I asked. Then he told me that he couldn't get some of the images that was required and gave me an example. They need 4 different images of the heart, but he only got two. I thanked him and proceeded to make a follow up appointment to go back. 

To my surprise, the radiologist signed off on the report noting that everything was fine and I did not need a follow up. I called Brooke Radiology back and was shocked when they told me that the technician said he never told me to go back for a follow up. 

Thankfully, my doctor's office booked me another appointment at North Shore Imaging. This second radiologist report was completely different and noted 2 abnormalities. I was then referred to BC Women's hospital where these 2 abnormalities were confirmed. 

Had I not insisted on a second ultrasound and relied on the radiologist report from Brooke Radiology, my baby would begin to suffer from a complicated heart defect immediately after birth. 

Bottom line is, if you want a reliable radiologist and technician, I would not suggest Brooke Radiology."
52,"OK so Dr. Riggall was recommended to me by my obgyn and he is supposed to be really good which I absolutely believe.
My first visit went fine, he was nice and on point.
We agreed on the upcoming hospital procedure, and then I was supposed to call a scheduling person Heidi. Since the doctor recommended to schedule my surgery a week after the visit, I was really pressed for time as you have to do all kinds of preop stuff, buy a bunch of meds, take time off work, and just prepare yourself mentally. Also it was time sensitive in regards to my cycle.
So here comes the annoying part. I called Heidi on Thursday at 9 am - voicemail, left a message. No call back. At lunch I called again, left a message, e-mailed. At the end of the day  she called me back. I told her that my doctor suggested next Wednesday for the surgery. She didn't ask any questions, said it might not work out since it was short notice and promised to call back. Rest of Thursday, Friday and Monday went by. Nothing. I wasn't really expecting for them to schedule everything right away as there were a lot of parties involved. I just needed information and proper customer service. 
Every time I called it went straight to voicemail. I had to call the office and complain. On Tuesday she called me back - no apologies. Just said that on Monday she received a response from the hospital (thanks for informing me right away) and that they could schedule me for next Monday and that I had to go to preop tomorrow!!!!!! How about it being way after the desired days of my cycle  - I asked (which she was supposed to consider as the office assured me she had all my records). She said to hold on, she would call the doctor. A minute later all of a sudden it was ok for me to come in for a surgery a week later.
Then she informed me about my out of pocket fee for the doctor. For the hospital fee I had to call myself. She gave me the number. All day I was trying to reach the hospital - wrong number - they had no record of me. Called her back - voicemail. Eventually on Wednesday I found out the right number and my fee. By that time I was absolutely exhausted and sure I wasn't going to  go through with the procedure.. Guess what - it's Friday and I haven't received any follow up calls.
Soooo I guess it's ok to lose a potential client. Good luck with your future customers Heidi !! :)"
53,"I cannot lie. I was A little skeptical and nervous how about booking this appointment. It was my first time getting lashes done and I wanted to make sure that I was in great hands. Me, like anybody else thought of all the things that could go wrong if I went to the wrong person. My sister got her lashes done and looked absolutely amazing and told me about spades beauty bar. She raved on and on about how great the front desk and the tech were. They've are very knowledgeable, clean, skilled, fun and professional! I booked my appointment and went in for the first time. Let me tell you, I came out looking like an absolute doll and feeling like it too. I love my make up and my look, but I hate spending the time each morning trying to achieve it. Getting my lashes done has cut down on my morning routine tremendously and I am consistent every time LOL! Amazing what lashes can do for you. I have already booked a couple fill and would not go elsewhere. There's too many fakes and phony. These guys are wonderful and they are the real deal! Got an appointment set from two weeks from now, so excited! If you have been playing with the idea of extensions, pull the trigger but sure you check out Betty and her team first. That way you're not running around town looking for the perfect lash technicians. I found mine at spades! Hope you ladies find the same."
54,"Let's face it. No one wants to find themselves at the oral surgeons. I arrived to see Dr Le a week ago and I was scared to death. I needed to have roots extracted and I had memories of my wisdom teeth being wrangled out with Novocaine and sheer muscle power. Cutting into my gum with a topical anesthetic? Hell no. I have never been to a dentist who even offers laughing gas so I had no idea I would be humanely knocked out for this procedure. God bless her! To be honest, I don't even remember opening my mouth. I went home in absolutely no pain and the healing process was NOTHING! The staff were all friendly, professional and skilled. I thought Dr Le calling me that evening to check on me was a nice touch. She could have passed that off onto someone else. Dr Le is willing to take the time to sit with you and answer any and all questions you have and I would go back there in a heartbeat. Who would have thought oral surgery could be easier than getting a cavity filled???"
55,"This has been truly the worst experience I have ever had dealing with billing at a Hospital. First, I was charge double the amount for a simple doctor consultation visit (360$). Despite correcting my address a total of 11 times, billing never updated my address. Fastforward to 1 years later I have one debt collection agency contact me about paying a bill I never received (because Tufts consistently used the wrong address for me). 
I paid bill to debt collection agency. Today, I received another phone call from another completely separate agency for the same bill! Call back old debt collection agency and they say bill was definitely paid to Tufts. They call Tufts to confirm. I now however have to someone prove to new agency that this bill was indeed paid and cannot even get a Tufts billing agent online. Serious, Serious issues with the billing department. How can someone call 11 times and still have the workers there get an inaccurate address. I've spent an entire workday trying to resolve this issue and it is still far from being resolved. Run, don't ever go to Tufts for treatment!!!!"
56,"I wish I could give this place negative stars.  Unbelievable that these places stay in business.  I should have known that since it was a ""chain"" it probably would not measure up in personalized service, but thought that it would at least offer competent service.  This place also seemed convenient because it was close to my house and I didn't want to take a lot of time off from work.  I had the ""exam"" special for $29.  They took 18--18---yes, I said 18 separate x-rays of my teeth (thank God there was no way I was pregnant!) and it seemed like the technician who did the x-rays had just gotten out of school because she was rough and it really hurt!  That should have been my first red flag to run the hell out of there.  But, I stayed---for 2 HOURS---for what I was told was going to be a 45 minute visit.  The doctor finally came in to tell me what was wrong with my teeth and gave me my ""treatment plan.""  I left supposedly ""needing"" nearly $3,500 worth of work done on my teeth.  I was going to need a ""deep cleaning"" for my teeth which was going to cost $759.  The staff tried to sell me on different payment plans and insurance.  Luckily, I said ""no"" to everything, reluctantly paid the $29 for a waste of my time, and made an appointment with a ""real"" dentist a few weeks later.  The ""real dentist"" had this awesome x-ray machine that just goes around your head and then I had 4 bite-wings done.  Pretty simple.  He also told me my bone density of my jaws was that of a 19 year old (and I'm 36), but Castle told me that my bone density was really failing me.  The ""real"" dentist gave me a great cleaning (I couldn't believe that the dentist, and not a dental hygienist did the actual cleaning!) and said that he was surprised it had been 3 years since I'd had a cleaning because my teeth looked so great.  But Castle said I needed that ""deep cleaning"" that was going to cost me $759.  Oh, and the ""real"" dentist never found that ""cavity"" that Castle Dental said I had.  I told this ""real"" dentist about my experience at Castle and he said that he should thank them because he has had many clients come from them because they have had such similar horrible experiences.  Yes, I had to pay $290 for this visit (out of pocket, no insurance) with the ""real"" dentist, but I got what I needed in a little over one hour.  I will be writing an excellent Yelp review for him because he was honest and provided me with wonderful and ethical care.  Do not waste your time or money on ANY of the Castle Dentle places.  There are so many better small family owned dentistry businesses that are much more deserving of your business."
57,"I was a patient at this clinic for around 2 years before I moved away from Mount Pleasant. This was a convenient location and it opens six days per week. However, I found the doctor I had  to have a strong sales pitch, which was what convinced me to start the invisalign program. During the period of my program he tried selling other treatments to me as well including a laser treatment.

There was not a single appointment the clinic did not reschedule at least once. No explanation was ever provided. Rescheduling always occurred one day before the appointment itself. However the clinic's policy required patient cancellation to be at least 48 hours prior. They send numerous reminders of appointments requiring confirmation by text messages and phone calls from weeks before the actual appointment only to cancel their own appointment the day before it was scheduled to happen.

As a result, during the two years I was a patient there, I was constantly bombarded with reminders and cancellation phone calls. 

Their receptionist, Tina, who seems to have only started working there in the last year or so, is extremely rude and mistake-prone. If you find that she can't even bother to spell your name correctly, you are not the only one she does this to. But you will never get an apology from her for the errors and confusion she causes - a typical receptionist, every office needs one. Just be sure to double check your invoice."
58,"If I could put less then one star I would. The customer service here SUCKS. The receptionist/ scheduler has a nasty disposition and is dishonest about their scheduling policies. This is one time I should have listened to the negative reviewers bc they all say the same thing about the staff.

If you are looking for a warm, caring, understanding and accommodating primary care office THIS IS NOT IT!!! They obviously have enough regular long time patients that they don't care about the service or experience they provide for newer customers. Even if the physicians are actually good it doesn't matter because most people like myself don't want to have a bad experience with the front staff every time just to see the doctor. 

There are way too many physician choice in the Atlanta area for anyone to opt to deal with a receptionist who always has a nasty attitude, gives you misinformation, and is rude!!! 

If your looking for a new primary care physician office.... KEEP LOOKING!"
59,"If you're looking for honest, compassionate people to care for you and your loved ones, keep looking! I scheduled a preventative care appointment which is covered by my insurance. The doctor brought up other health topics, and asked to refill my prescriptions. She ordered in office tests that later I learned were only done to pad my bill. At no point did she tell me by her bringing up these topics, I would incur other charges. I got a $187 bill following what was supposed to be a $0 office visit. I was first sent to Gabriel who was very apathetic. My messages to the Office Manager in the portal kept bouncing back. I went to the office and Ashley gave me the card of Dr. Tonto who has never returned a single phone call nor email. I've lost my job during this pandemic. I don't want to ruin my credit over this so I will have to find a way to pay this bill but I will be filing every complaint available to me. This is criminal! Save yourself the headache, don't use this provider"
60,Straight up butcher. You better hope he gets it right the first time because if he doesn't it'll be your fault and cost you 10k more. Dont expect anything from this guy. Keep looking!
61,"Good: personal & professional staff. Easy to find location. Skilled Dr. Informed staff. Compassionate approach. Will answer any and all questions, though you may have to remind them.

Bad: cattle-call like experience you get an any MD office. High prices. No appts, based on first-come-first-serve. Small adjustments for a high cost. Hours of operation.

I debated three stars,yet in some aspects of their clinic call for four stars. I find the office to have a decent atmosphere and all of the staff to be helpful and curteous. There are some negative points I really take issue with however. 
The staff and the dr get good marks for personality and for being professional. They usually answer my questions and do what they can to be helpful in every way. I had to ask the same question on two seperate visits before I finally got the info I was looking for, but the Dr himself took out specific time despite a hectic schedule that week to call me and answer my quetions. This is a five star thing to do. I could have been more insistant during the visit but anyone who has experienced massage, chiropractics or accupuncture knows that after an a visit you are often foggy brained in a positive way.
My first visit was nice but rocky and I kept with them for a few more visits since the visits are nice, the reviews seems good and I was in recover so that means foggy brain. During my first visit I thought I had a set appt but it's a first-come-first-serve scenario, which might be fine if they were opened on the weekends or past six pm.

I felt at ease in talking with the staff and meeting the dr. He did his exam, the office manager did hers (I'm not sure what certification she has for this since she's an office mngr, but I didn't ask either), and then I was left in the room for forty minutes while he worked on other patients. I should have spoken up, but I decided to trust them and see how they operate. They sincerely apologized for forgetting me and honestly if the service is great I don't mind a slip-up of that particular nature. The first adjustment was very small, but I had just been in an accident so perhaps it was the best thing and I felt in no position to question as I haven't been to many chiropractors and I was recovering, but the nature of the adjustments several weeks later hasn't gotten lengthier or more involved.

We discussed the billing and how ball-park figures they would charge my insurance, and Cindy made it clear I am liable if my insurance denies any of it. Fair enough. Upon my second, perhaps third visit, I asked for more detailed info on the billing since we have a better idea of what we're working with and I was shocked to find that three minutes on their rolling table (which was pretty nice) cost about $35, the adjustment was about $80 or $90... for ten minutes which included a neck twist and chest compression maneuver. She said something about a rib adjustment. I claimed I wasn't aware of getting my ribs worked on, only neck snap and chest compression type situation, but she replied that the rib adjustment is small.

Frankly, I don't understand why the entire visit was about $120 when I spent most of it in the waiting room, three mintues on a table, about five minutes talking to the dr, and even less in his arms getting worked on.

That's all the bad. The good is that the staff are professional and curteous, the dr does express compassion, real knowledge and eagerness to make me better. He gave me advice on movements I can do to help myself. They did seem to lay out a treatment plan that made sense, but that may have changed. They made great effort to answer all of my questions. I would definte it as a cattle-call experience with a dr and staff who really care. If it were either less expensive or if the treatments were more involved I would give four or five stars."
62,"I have been with this group for 9 yrs now starting in 2010. Everything has been great and over the years, the quality and inconsistency of staffing has gone drastically down. One huge struggle is you can almost never get someone to pick up the phone. And when you leave a v/m, all you can do is keep your fingers crossed that someone will return your call...and it's never in a timely manner. For someone like me who needs to get refills on my allergy drops on a quarterly basis, it has been such a pain to re-order them. The last experience I had was the last straw. I left multiple messages with no return call. I called one more time and finally got a receptionist who was super rude and unapologetic to my issues and was super defensive. All I wanted was to get my refill placed. Then she proceeded to tell me that I had a balance on my acct and I needed to pay it before she could help me. I was in shock as I explained to her that I had not received anything from my insurance company and that the last time I ordered the refill, no one even mentioned a balance. So...I hung up the phone and decided to transfer my care elsewhere. If being a patient for almost a decade is not enough to warrant some respect, then I'll go find it somewhere else. I have now transitioned my care to TEXAN ALLERGY and it has been such a blessing. The staff are super friendly and make you feel valued and they have multiple locations so there is one convenient no matter where you live."
63,"UPDATE: I'm adding 3 stars to this review. I did receive a call from Karen and she owned their part of this situation. I find it very impressive when a business owns their responsibilities and makes effort to improve.  Thank you, Karen, for taking the time to address my concerns and right this situation. That's exactly what one wants in a professional office and my confidence in your services is much improved. 


Wow. 
Just, wow. 

I've been going to A WOMAN'S TIME for over a decade. I've been loyal to Dr. Dunlap (whom I adore); however, since Dr.Dunlap left the practice, the service has been abominable. Terrible. Rude. 

I just called because I received a bill. This was odd because I have called no less than 12 times since receiving this procedure and no one has ever mentioned a bill. That makes sense because before I left their office from this very same procedure, I paid in full as out of pocket. 

Granted, today is Labor Day, so my intention was to not work, but I wanted to follow-up on the miscommunication. I followed the prompts on the message and called the number provided for the office manager, Kim. 

I've known Kim for years. She knows me. During this call Kim literally yelled at me for calling her on a holiday. 

Ummmmmmm.... what? 

I explained that I was merely following the prompts and if they wanted to not receive calls on a holiday -- don't answer. She hung up on me.  To Kim's credit she did call back crying about 15 minutes later, and apologized. 

Ok. I told her we could follow-up during the week. 

UPDATE: I am now in October and I returned Kim's voicemail. Immediately I was queried about emails and voicemails she'd sent to me. I explained that I missed one, got one, and that is why I was following-up now. When I asked why I'd received a bill after nearly a year has passed, I was told to speak to Dr.Hudson's sister the co-owner. After waiting about 5 minutes, I was greeted by a woman whom I'd never met and who immediately cut me off when I began to engage in questions about several issues that had gone severely wrong with their office. 

She was combative, acerbic, & rude.  I can understand why Kim was crying. I would too if I had to work there. I explained that I could see this was going nowhere, I was hanging up, & I couldn't be more disappointed with their service. 

Something has gone drastically wrong over there. After choosing my insurance specifically so that I would be able to continue with Dr.Dunlap & that clinic, I will now never ever return nor suggest the clinic, even to frenemies. 

Instead I would encourage any woman in the NW to go up the street to Joya. They're SO MUCH MORE PLEASANT TO DEAL WITH! 

I hope A Woman's Time figures out that patients are the core of their business and pleasant conversation, even about things like billing, needn't be so challenging. The impression I received was that I should consider myself lucky to be there at all & regardless of what my Dr. has told me, they will demand payment whenever they damned well please. 

Thanks for housing Dr.Dunlap for so long guys! Sorry your front desk staff is so scattered.  You've completely messed up my medical billings and been jerks when I tried to figure out why and what exactly your reasoning was. I will never return as a patient. If you're considering them, I'd STRONGLY suggest looking elsewhere."
64,"This place is awful the office manager is extremely rude along with nurse managers extremely  insensitive when you require immediate  appointment ,  there is no one to voice your opinion to you.  This practice will retaliate  if you ever complain regarding your  service/treatment and will remove you from their practice.      I will definitely  never refer anyone to them."
65,"Went here for a pregnancy confirmation for insurance, I'm not from Austin and this place was recommended by a friend who also went for a pregnancy confirmation. I was asked basic questions but was pretty thrown by the religious questions asking my beliefs. When consulting with the nurse who was otherwise very nice she was pretty pushy about my lack of belief in god and when I would explain religion just wasn't for me she asked me why I thought the way I did. It was pretty awkward and uncomfortable. Thankfully I won't have to go back. I don't know if she knew she was crossing lines or not but it was really unprofessional to me. I now know that they are a religious clinic, so I would advise to anyone that isn't a Christian not to go here."
66,"This is the worst staff I have ever dealt with. I've been going to dr gillman a few years. The hygienist did a great job. But there is too many hands in the billing dept. No one knows what's going on..
My insurance wasn't billed correctly and I had to pay out of pocket. I Will not be treated this way."
67,I had such a good cleaning today.  The hygienist did a great job. My teeth felt so clean. Beautiful office and friendly front desk staff.  Everyone made me feel so welcomed.  Can't wait to go back in 6 months.  Dr Duka was great as well.
68,"If you have United Healthcare medical insurance, you have to go to LabCorp.  I went to this one when I worked in the UCF area and was very disappointed. 

First, the waiting room was dirty.  There was no sign in sheet, and the dude at the desk had his shirt unbuttoned low to show off his thick gold chain and whisps of thick chest hair.   Not a good first impression.

Second, the labtech that drew my blood was nervous, I'm assuming because he was shaking.  REALLY not good.

Third, they lost my blood results.  I went to my doctor's appointment, they asked me why I hadn't had my blood test yet.  We went back and forth before they called the lab, and the lab had no record of me being there.  About and hour later, they called the doctor's office and told them they found my blood test and that it all came back negative.  

Uhhhmmm... yeeeeah.  It was an allergy test, and I pretty much sneeze all year long. 

Don't go here.  Just don't."
69,"Back in early November I called them wanting to know about availability for christmas boarding and pricing. I was told that the cost to board my dog during Christmas is $25 per night. I went ahead and booked my dog, I called back in early December to confirm. GOOD thing I did because they said they did not have my dog on file for boarding and that I would have to pay a $50 deposit which I was fine with since that at least meant I had some proof that I made a reservation via my bank account. On the day I went to drop off my dog the price JUMPED to $40 a night. This is extremely upsetting when they went to give me the bill one of the front desk woman said to the other to make sure it was at the ""right price"". I can understand that it could be an accident of a new employee who got the pricing wrong but if thats so then you should call clients to let them know of the mistake and not wait til they walk in the day of drop off only to be forced to pay the new amount. Will never be bringing my dog back here again."
70,"It's been almost two years in November that I been here for my prescription eyeglasses. I wanted to write this review because I want other people to know what kind of product they are potentially buying. I got my prescription eyeglasses from here and within less than a year the coding on my glasses was pealing.  So, I brought it in the store and they fixed it but then 10 months go by and I am having the same issue again. Brought it back to the store and they said they can't fix it and gave me an excuse that it's a normal thing that happens with prescription glasses, mind you I have never had this happened before. I have been using prescription glasses since HS and never had any of my glasses coding peal. You can be sure that I will never go back to any LensCrafters in the USA only because I feel that their product did not deliver. By far the worst!!! I strongly do not recomend this company!!!"
71,"I had my first appointment here yesterday and I probably will seek help elsewhere. The staff was friendly enough, but there were several points where I felt like the person taking the pictures of my teeth didn't really know what he was doing. Then they had someone come in to measure my gums, and she told me that I had gingivitis and then left the room. The next person to come in was (I guess?) the doctor. She basically took five minutes to look at my teeth, told me I was doing ""well"" but that I had ""a few cavities"". Then she said I can head out to billing who will tell me what to do next.

This is MY FAVORITE PART. When I get to billing, the woman (who was actually really nice, like mainly the reason I'm giving two stars as opposed to one) told me that we needed to schedule a cleaning and, get this, EIGHT FILLINGS. EIGHT. FILLINGS. I guess she could tell by the look on my face that this was news to me. She said, ""they didn't tell you?"" And I said that they told me ""a few"" which I assumed meant, I dunno, three?

I've also never been to a dentist's office for over an hour and not gotten a cleaning? That was what I assumed I was in there for. I'm just very disappointed that the people examining me seemed to have absolutely no investment in what they were doing. They smiled and told me everything is going GREAT, and then left it up to someone else to tell me what I actually needed. That seemed wildly unprofessional and unfair to her and to me. 

Yeah, I'm definitely getting these fillings somewhere else."
72,"I do NOT like going to this place and my last visit reminded me why. I just went here Monday and seems like they have new doctors and staff there. The doctor I had was Dr.Priya Balaraman. The lady on the phone told me Dr.Raman was really good and that eased me. From the moment I saw Raman when I was sitting in the lobby she didn't look friendly whatsoever. The red head girl that came and took me to the back was VERY nice and friendly. The other staff back there weren't in my opinion. Seemed like a bunch of young people that fool around, play around, and gossip a lot. Anyway of course since I hadn't been there in a while they had to do x-rays. Ever since I was a kid I have never liked doctors sticking things near the back of my throat. So of course having the x-rays done was a problem and I ended up not doing it after trying a few times.

They had some big Mexican chick trying to force it in my mouth and I just flat out said nope, got out of the chair, and got my stuff together. If they had to do the x-rays then I didn't want to waste their time and other people's time and was going to leave. Then Dr.Raman saw me and said what are you doing and I said I'm leaving because I can't do the x-rays. So then she proceeds to say we can still see you and do the pan view but it doesn't look into the teeth. So I said OK and stayed. Well Dr.Raman sat there talking mess about me and the fact that I couldn't do the x-rays. She was doing a cleaning on another patient and there were no walls so of course I could hear everything she said. Plus she was only a few feet away from me. In fact sitting in the chair if you turn around you could see her. Lol which she didn't seem to care. So when she came to me she checked my mouth and asked me what brought me there and I told her. She asked me if I floss everyday and I told her yes and I also told her my ritual which is flossing, gargling with peroxide, and brushing my teeth.

She made a weird noise and didn't say anything so I asked her was that a bad thing and she said it wasn't good to gargle with peroxide everyday but that was probably why my teeth are so white. All the while I'm thinking so you weren't going to tell me that you were just going to be silent and continue writing. Anyway I'm scheduled for a cleaning on Tuesday which I'm going to cancel it just until I can see the oral maxillofacial surgeon they recommended me to see. Plus I want a new doctor. I don't care for Dr.Raman and her curtness. And due to my insurance this is the only dental place I'm stuck with. Oh and the actual place is sort of buried in a corner. Like some hole in a wall."
73,"Blown away by the PA Theresa! She is very knowledgeable and skillful. Dr. Crotty came by to assist but for the first time in my life I didn't care that a physician was not directing. Very well trained staff throughout the spectrum from appointment to the visit and finishing at the checkout. My highest honors! Forgot to mention the new place looks great and clean. From a Pharmacist perspective, their process of controlling medications is stellar!"
74,"I haven't been anywhere else but my experience speaks for itself.  I expected to be there for around 4 hours because they told me 3-3.5.  Thats all fine I suppose...however, granted this was my first time, I ate a good breakfast at 730 AM was hooked up to the machine around11:15 and by 1135 ish I didn't feel so well.  I couldn't keep pumping my hand and my arm went cold.  As one of the ladies who worked there walked by my bay I said to her ""I don't feel very well"".  She said ""okay"" and walked over to another donor!!!!!!!  WHo was fine!  I looked at my machine and the red light was on meaning the blood flow had stopped.  I tried to say it again and louder so maybe someone else would come but my voice was faint, my head was light and I was sweating and I was out like a light before I finished the sentence. It was dark for a minute and I vaguely was aware as a vomited all over myself (sorry, gross story but bare with me).....I awoke to a bucket in my face and four workers around me.  Including the one that walked away from me!  She said to her superior ""I came right over and asked if she was ok and she just had a blank stare.  I turned off the machine when she vomited"".  WHat a LIAR!!!!!  I was confused and weak but I could still hear and remember.  The next girl to hang out with me was getting frustrated because I didn't want to sit up and I wasn't drinking my gatorade fast enough for her.  She was talking my ear off and all I wanted to do was just chill and regain my wits.  She said ""ok, I need you to chug that and start on the next one""  I should have told her where to stick it because I only ended up throwing it up ON THE DRIVE HOME!  The medic on staff was nice and good.  The doctor was (I think she was the doctor) was nice but I did not feel very well taken care of all in all, and it was not fun to be in a situation where you don't know what happened to you and they don't know or seem to truly care.  That was the worst part.  And that chic that walked away from me came back after her smoke break (I know because she reeked of it) and said oh this is really common, it happens all the time.  And I said really?!  All the time? She looked embarrased and another lady in there says ""well, maybe 2%...out of.............100...""  I said and that is all the time?  Whatever.  I think maybe if they all handled it better I would consider returning knowing I would be in good hands.  I didn't feel like that at all.  It was uncomfortable and embarassing and it felt like they just wanted to get me out.

Oh and I ended up being there for 6 hours."
75,"The day of visit 07/13, writing 11 days after. I'm an easy-going, laid-back person and this is my first review ever. Tried to forget, let it go, but still hurts. This is how it was... 

The lady at the check in with red curly hair was really nice, sweet, friendly and welcoming. Even though I didn't make appointment she found an artist who could help me with my walk-in. 5* to her for that! 
Here comes the artist- Chris Debarge! First, let me tell you that he might have been a good artist to somebody else but not to me. May be he is a good person and on that day was in a bad mood but that sucks for you, Chris, where your job is to provide an excellent customer service!!! Chris came up asking what kind of tattoo do I want, told him I want a name- he laughed!!!!! And asked What, boyfriends name? (Excuse me but it's none of your business! Imagine how embarrassed would you feel if that is exactly what you wanted to tattoo!)

But no, my mom recently passed away (on that day it was 40days) I was feeling emotional and wanted to tattoo her name right there at that moment. As I mentioned earlier I didn't make an appointment and didn't know exactly what I want but thought since ARTISTS work there - they would help. ""Dearest"" Chris just put my moms name in the computer program with different handwritings, scrolled down 4 pages, then I finally liked one but asked to help me out and make it a bit artistic (you know, ""A"" bigger, ""B"" with the spin) he wrote it down on a paper. I was looking at it for couple seconds trying to figure out how else I can make it perfect for me, HE sighed and said- ""I can't sit here all day long trying to please you!"" (word to word). That very second I got up, because couldn't hold my tears. (Aren't you there to make people happy, help them get what they want, be a  person who can show your talent through tattoo, express your thoughts, ideas in it and then get admired by people (may be become famous for the coolest tattoo artist in the world?). I found strength to ask for his card and say Thank you. He knew that I got very upset. The whole' appointment' with him was 3-4 mins, no more. 

I left. Will never come back. Will always tell my friends, acquaintances not to go there. I didn't ask for much. Just a name. Sorry, Chris, that apparently the only thing you can do is copy, paste, tattoo. By the way, The tattoo on your hand is dumb and so simple same as your brain! I feel bad for the management that because of only one person you give a very bad experience of the whole place. I wish prosperity to Stingray, and lifetime unemployment for Chris"
76,"Some of the office staff is often rude, and awful, overall. I hate that I have to deal with the office staff, in order to see my awesome doctor, Dr. Alward. I have gone to doctors in this practice (and seen several retire) since 1968. 
The most recent incident was because I changed insurance companies and they required a ""pre-authorization"" on a prescription.
Walgreens and I both notified Dr. Alward's staff.
His medical assistant, Mallory (who may be related to Debbie, the office manager), called me to tell me that ""it was denied by my insurance, but that Dr. Alward had a coupon card for me."" And "" that it was good for a years worth, and should cost me only $15 each refill "". 
Great, right? Except she was WRONG.
Mallory had never contacted my insurance to complete the pre-authorization , which I was led to believe (by Mallory) had been done, and it was denied.
But, hey, that coupon that would get my refills for $15 was better than my co-pay of $50. 
WRONG. AGAIN, MALLORY!
That would work ,to reduce my $50 co-pay, IF MALLORY HAD PLACED THE PHONE CALL TO BLUE CROSS BLUE SHIELD, SO IT WOULD BE COVERED BY MY INSURANCE!!
Otherwise, it is $261 !!!
After multiple phone calls, AND a trip over there today, MALLORY finally did her job. 
Now, the reason that I say that MALLORY may be related to the office manager, Debbie, is because Debbie refused to acknowledge that it was Mallory's fault. Yes. It was Mallory's fault. 
She did not make the necessary call to the insurance company. 
She gave me, from Dr. Alward, a coupon from the manufacturer that WOULD ONLY SAVE ME MONEY WHEN USED COMBINED WITH MY INSURANCE!
The insurance company that she knew had denied it, until receiving more information from my doctor's office.
If at any point, any of the staff had simply acknowledged their errors, the inconvenience it caused me, and just said ""I'm sorry it happened""...
But that didn't happen. No accountability. Just arrogance, as if MALLORY did me a favor by FINALLY doing her job, almost a month after it all began. 
Dr. Alward is a great doctor! None better. If only you could avoid the rude and/or incompetent staff..."
77,"I have no confidence in this place. I went to Dr. Jay because she is a board certified gynecologist who used to be at Southboro Medical Center. I was interested in bio-identical hormones or HRT. Instead, there was no gynecological exam, but there was a long intake. I liked that it was thorough, but I was concerned that Dr. Jay made some predictions about my overall hormone levels based on anecdote that turned out to be not even remotely true. For example, she said that my adrenal function must be depleted because I was born 2 months premature. Blood tests showed no such thing.

I agreed to the battery of blood tests because I knew I had allergies. It had been a few decades since I had them done, so I said yes.

At the follow up appt., I agreed to another set of tests, my foolishness, because it cost $400 out of pocket. A quick web search showed that $250 is more average. I agreed to this test because I was told that my family's history of breast cancer was possibly related to the object of the test. Websearching later showed no such link, just a POSSIBILITY of such a link.

She also recommended a website of a ""doctor"" who specialized in this substance, but he was no doctor at all. He said so on his website! He said he asks people to call him doctor, because he is a ""healer"".

Also, I bought the supplements, not knowing that they were not vitamins, but compounds that had icky side effects, like headaches. 

The reason I came in was partially addressed with a tube of estriodol that I could have gotten from a conventional gynecologists. All the rest of hundreds of dollars of ""care"" addressed nothing of value to me.

I expected more from a board certified doctor. Of particular concern during the first visit, and my fault for not being more careful, was her statement that, when it came to all these blood tests, ""I am just learning about this"". Given how expensive this all was, and how almost none of it was covered by insurance, I would rather she learn on someone else."
78,"Absolute gold standard dentist, from warm and inviting front desk to gentle techs to the ease of insurance and billing. Dr. Anjomi helped get our daughter into braces with a highly reputable, qualified ortho nearby, saw me through an actual crisis in one of Boston's worst blizzards on record, and we never dread our regular appointments. (In fact, my next one's coming up in March and if anything, I wish I was going in sooner!) Marvelous team, beautiful office, impeccable dental work."
79,"Hello, I wanted to tell you about my Journey wit Sono Bello. I was at a very low point a little over a year ago. My Step-Son had been diagnosed with a terminal illness. I was unhappy with me, tired, not eating healthy, overweight. My husband and I decided that we needed a much needed Vacation from the worry and stress. We decided on a cruise. I saw your infomercials and thought ""Why not?"" What do I have to lose by getting a free consult. I loved Shab and Dr Malin, they both were very helpful at guiding me to decide what areas to focus on. I found myself thinking could it really happen? Could Sono Bello do what they say they can? Help me in my journey to feel better about me?
 
I scheduled to have two appointments. Five areas each, within Two weeks if each other (I'm also a Hairdresser, it was Christmas time of 2016 and I had clients I couldn't let down. I didn't take very much time off) it was hard, but it was so worth. I became to believe in what Sono Bello could do for me. I schedule a month later to do two more areas. After I schedule that appointment my step-son was taken to the hospital and arrived non-responsive. They got him back, but he was put on a permanent Trach tube. I decided to keep my appointment for the third procedure....through this hard time...I sold Sono Bello. The hope the dream to everyone I saw...so began my journey.
 
Through the stress of Jordan recovering from his procedure (I was also his ""manager"", managing doctor appointments and his finances, he was 22 at this time) having a teenager at home and a full time Job, I had ever excuse we give ourselves, to detour from my Journey of a new me.
 
My husband and I went on a Cruise in April out of Florida. The months leading up to this were full of challenges and amazement at how my body was changing. The confidence, the peace, feeling secure in myself. I was 245 at my starting weight loss point. By the time I sought out Sono Bell I was 176. At my 9 month mark, I was 145 pounds. I had a new body, new confidence and looked younger. I turn 50 this summer. I am still amazed at the transformation. What my doctor said he could do for me, he did. I will be forever grateful. 
 
My step-son, Jordan passed away on March 12th. He gave me the courage to not be afraid. To just to it. To live my dream of recreating myself. I didn't have to accept life the way it was. I could not change his outcome, but I could change mine. To live a healthier, fuller life."
80,"I first came to Atlanta Midtown Gynecology in February and was thrilled with the care I received. Dr. Perry was kind and didn't dismiss my concerns. He took the time to explain everything and make a plan of action after the exam. 

On Monday July 23rd, I came back in as the same previous issue was arising. I got the same great care I received back in February!

The issue herein lies with how follow up results are handled in Dr. Perry's office. After not hearing back, I called to check in on Monday, July 29th (one week later.) Apparently the results had been ready, but Dr. Perry had not had he time yet to call me. The receptionist let me know that he does results calls between seeing patients. 

Okay, fine. I leave a note for a call back as I'm concerned for my health and the issue is persisting. In Dr. Perry's defense, he did try to call me back later in the day, but I was at work and could not answer immediately. I call back, literally the next minute, and am told he's with a patient. 

I have called probably 6-8 more times since Monday, and still he has not gotten back to me. I STILL HAVE NO IDEA WHAT MY RESULTS ARE. I understand he's busy, but it shocks me that time isn't set aside each day to make these calls. 

I have been left feeling worried for my health for nearly two weeks now and I feel that this is unacceptable. I call again today and tell the receptionist I would like access to my results as I'm going to go elsewhere. She told me to create a LabCorp account and seemed completely unbothered at the situation. 

Overall, I'm extremely disappointed. I thought I had found a reliable gynecology office, but this does not seem to be the case."
81,"Poor bedside manner. Was forced to use them after I ended up in the er for pneumonia. Then got really sick coughing up blood two months later to be told that they couldn't see me until January! I ended up back in the er and was admitted to the hospital. My doctor was in the hospital the whole time and never once came to my room to check up on me or be involved with my care. The attending doctor, while I was admitted the 2nd time, dr. Michael Warner was awesome. He went above and beyond to make me feel like a person. I cannot say that for anyone else here. After I was discharged, I called an asked to switch physicians because a) she didn't have time to see me and b) I was very disappointed in the lack of attention I received and the fact she was in the hospital THE WHOLE TIME scooping up new patients than taking care of her existing ones. All of a sudden when I asked to change doctors, she had availability to see me. Despite this, they claim it's office policy to be stuck with a doctor you do not feel takes care of your needs. I believe this is illegal as well. Either way, no one returns calls nor is there a way to contact someone who knows what they are talking about. It's a shame that there are not more pulmonologists in Austin. If you have a choice, choose somewhere else."
82,"Dr. Schneider and her staff are some of the most homophobic, incompetent, spiteful medical staff I have ever encountered. I was truly shocked and want to ensure that no one else suffers as I did.

Dr. Schneider's new patient paperwork includes a question about ""sexual partners"". You can check off ""males"", ""females"", or ""bisexual"". Leaving aside the grammatical error here--no one sleeps exclusively with 'bisexuals'--I figured this signaled some level of sensitivity toward lesbian health needs and that the office was accepting. I could not have been more wrong.

The nurse who did my intake did not bother looking at this form. She asked me if I was using birth control, and when I said I didn't need any, she asked if I was a virgin. I had to come out to her, which made it pointless to have filled out the form, and was awkward. Then, she made the immature and inappropriate joke, ""Oh, yeah, boys have cooties, ew!"" As though being gay were like being 5 years old and thinking the opposite sex has cooties. I do not, in fact, think anyone has cooties. I'm here for a medical exam. 

This was annoying, but the real issue was that, in her discomfort, this nurse skipped over the fact that lesbians actually can contract HPV and therefore should be tested for that. Luckily, I found this out after my appointment (via a friend who I was sharing this story with) and was able to retroactively apply an HPV test to my PAP smear (all was normal, tyvm!).

Secondly, Dr. Schneider ordered an internal ultrasound because I had been having some irregular spotting and pain. I've had internal ultrasounds before, and while they are not ""fun"", per se, I know I can handle them just fine. This office only had one enormous wand, and the technician tried to ram it up me--no joke--like a drunk frat boy going at it. There was no lubricant applied, and she didn't even bother to notice that she was pushing against the wrong place, trying to shove my labia minora up inside me instead of the instrument. When I asked to try myself, she lasted about five seconds before complaining that I ""wasn't doing anything"" and needed to go out in the hall to drink water so she could do an external ultrasound. 

The doctor called a few days later claiming the ultrasound was normal, but again, I spoke with personal contacts in and out of the medical field and was advised that an external ultrasound simply is not as conclusive as an internal. I was in the difficult position now of having to either find a new doctor or ask for a follow up conversation with the doctor. Dr. Schneider would not respond to my multiple messages or phone calls; she wouldn't even reply to the messages I left in the patient portal. She told a nurse to tell me that she (Dr. S.) ""didn't know why this happened"" with the technician, and that I could ""come back for an internal ultrasound free of charge"". I asked, ""Thanks, but how will I know this will be any different? Will they use a smaller wand? Will the technician be more patient? I don't see the point of coming back otherwise; being on that table is very vulnerable."" I never got a call back or an answer to this question, so I made an appointment elsewhere (will report back on whether that doctor is any better).

Before the appointment with my other doctor, I requested that my records (ultrasound, pap smear, and bloodwork results) be sent to the new doctor. Dr. Schneider's staff could not even handle doing this right. When I followed up the week before, they still had not sent it, and claimed the other office's fax line was ""busy"". They emailed me scanned version, and it did not contain the bloodwork or ultrasound details. It did, however, contain all of the notes various office staff had left Dr. Schneider from my phone calls. They describe me as impossible to appease, and string quotes together from my phone calls that suggest they either did not understand my point or did not care to. I was horrified to think this was what got passed onto Dr. Schneider (no wonder she never called me back!) and that they would so casually send these to me and to another doctor. 

Truly, this seems like hateful and spiteful behavior...not at all professional. Lastly, it still puzzles me to no end that they would take the time to type up these meticulous notes about my phone calls and still not be able to get back to me with answers to my questions. 

If you have gone to this doctor and need someone to talk to, or are looking for LGBTQ competent care, or want to hear about any more of this, please feel free to direct message me. 

If you're struggling with vaginismus, I would like to recommend Dylan Davies as a therapist and Sullivan Physical Therapy--specifically, a wonderful PT there named Jessica."
83,"Check the filtered reviews to get an accurate picture of what awaits you if you become a patient of Rainbow. I have many concerns but the most recent is below.

I've been taking my daughter to Rainbow since she was an infant, 16 years ago.  What was once an good practice has turned into a poorly run practice with multiple glaring issues.   I took my daughter there for a visit in March to renew her  BC prescription. After a long wait she was seen and the visit proceeded as normal.  When I called the pharmacy the following month to get the prescription filled, they informed me that Dr Tyler only sent an RX for 1 month with no refills.   Over the next two days I tried to get Dr Rogers's mistake corrected.  I was repeatedly told that they would call me back but they did not call a single time.  I was told they would speak to the Dr between patients for two days, that never happened.   One of the staff members seemed sympathetic, the rest were simply rude and made no effort to help.   Keep in mind that the prior month we paid for an office visit to renew this RX. By the end of the second day I reached my breaking point.  I was very rude and angry to the staff after the repeated lies and multiple calls that went unreturned.  I explained that it is important for BC pills to no be missed and it has been two days to correct the problem and I needed to be done stat!   Finally, after Dr Rogers left the office on Friday without calling in a refill I called again and got the ""office closed"" recording.  After leaving an angry voicemail for the on-call Doctor, a refill was called in to the pharmacy but it was too late to pick it up that day.  As a result it was 3 days between me advising them of their error until a got the rx filled. Also it's important to note that Dr Rogers still never bothered to correct it over 2 days, the on-call doctor filled it.  

It's now May and I called the pharmacy for a refill.  Once again there were no refills submitted for what should ha e been a 6 month prescription.   It's inexcusable that they did not correct the error last month.  I called them this morning and it's the same scenario as last month.  Dr Tyler can't be bothered to do the job he was paid to do.  The staff has advised me 3 times today that they would call me back and now the office is closed and I have not been called.    The second person I spoke to told me the Dr was not in today.  I advised her that the previous nurse told me he was in today AND I saw his Lamborghini out front when I drove by.  She then said ""well he is not in now"".   I can't determine whether this is incompetence or simply contempt for the patient once they have cashed the check for the office visit. 

Read the filtered reviews, we have had very similar experiences.  We will change doctors, this place is simply not fit to provide medical care to children.  Recommendation, avoid at all cost.

Reply to the response below:
Sophie, your comment about needing an office visit for our request is 100% factually inaccurate.  We DID have an office visit for the specific reason of getting her BC rx renewed.  When submitting that rx to the pharmacy Dr Tyler failed to call it in for the 6 months it should have been written for.  The following month when this saga began, he was supposed to correct his mistake and call it in for the remaining 5 months but he couldn't be bothered to do that and the on call Dr only submitted the request for 1 month.   That is what lead to once again having to call to get the RX called in correctly and not getting a response until after I posted this review.  Do not misrepresent the facts.  The facts are that we paid for an office visit to get a 6 month prescription for BC, the Dr failed to call it in correctly and failed again the following 2 months.  You do NOT need a monthly office visit for BC, you only need the visit every 6 months which we paid for."
84,"Larry O.
The work was done in 11-09
The Doctor I had was very bad. Not worth 1 star.  Dr Disher She did a Hernia repair. Gave me MRSA. and when I had the stitches taken out my stomach was so swollen she could only cut the knots  out. The rest of the stitches was buried in the swollen part of my stomach. She asked if it hurt. I said yes. She said come back in a couple day if it gets worse. When she ran out of the room. She was in the room less then 2 minutes. She should have gave me antibiotics then she didn't. I went home. Two day later I had to go to emergence clinic. The MRSA went to my right leg. It got so big I could not bend my nee. They put on antibiotics for a year before the MRSA was gone. It was the most pain in my life. It did a lot of damage to my body. Dr Disher should have put me on antibiotics when she cut the knots in the stitches. instead she runs out of the room. I've never been back after that. She has no business being a doctor.  I don't know how she sleeps nights. I would not have her work on my dog. 
It's 8 -2-13 And I still have pain from it. Look out for Doctor Disher She's no good.
I can show pictures if you want to see"
85,"This place is usually not too bad. In the past, the front desk was an old, cranky lady and the doctors were nice and helpful.

The other day, my daughter had been sick for a week, so my husband suggested that I take her in. I looked for a 24-hour urgent care, but all I found was this place that closed at midnight. I was trying to make an appointment online, but it said 11:40 & 11:50 walk-ins only.  I raced down there and we entered at 11:49. We approached the desk and I saw a man shaking his head. I thought he was going to turn us away, but instead, he announced that ""we have 9 minutes"". Even if it was a joke, I don't take my child's health as one. I kept my calm as Marisel, at the front desk, asked why we were in. I told her the symptoms that my daughter was having. I filled out a form, as instructed, and Missy took us back immediately to take her vitals. She was very compassionate and asked concerning questions about her state.

She brought us to a room and said the doctor would be right in. Our ""friendly"" greeter, Ryan, walked in and said hello again. I was silent, as I did not want to say anything rude. He then ""explained"" that they were joking about patients walking in 10 minutes before they closed. I held my nasty comment and just laughed.

I barely heard anything he said about the diagnosis because I still had his comments reverberating in my head. He said he was going to prescribe her antibiotics, he recommended Slushees to soothe her throat.

He left and Jennifer came in to bring her prescription and discharge paperwork. I had forgotten to ask him about her red/swollen eye (which I DID mention at the front desk), so she left for a moment and came back with an additional rx for medicated eyedrops. She was very sweet and thorough. She even recommended the 24-hour pharmacy next door.

We proceeded back to the front desk to check out. Marisel, as well as the other girls, did not rush us at all. She walked us out and gave an appropriate goodbye.

If he never made the remarks that he did, I would have probably given 4-5 stars. Unfortunately, one person can make a big difference."
86,"Dr. Reid was a pretty good doctor when I had him for a physical check up about 6 months ago. Problem is, I have tried scheduling multiple sick appointments since then as I've had an issue with reoccurring strep and have yet to see him since then. He seems to always be gone or unavailable when I try making an appointment with him. 

What I find more annoying is the fact that they happen to be closed pretty frequently on days they call ""holidays"" (since when is July 3rd a holiday?) The front desk staff is extremely rude, inconsistent, and uncaring. Whatever is going on with you, they seem to have no care for. I once called for a sick appointment and the First Lady at the desk who answered told me they were completely booked until Monday. I told them I would give a call back to see if I should wait until then or go to an urgent care. I called back not even 30 minutes later and a different front desk lady gave me 4 or 5 different appointment times they had available for the day. Really? As if 4-5 people happened to cancel within the 30 minutes I last called... Yeah right. The nurse aids also seems to have apathetic attitude as when I was getting my yearly check up and needed blood drawn, I explained my fear of needles to Dr. Reid who was great at trying to make me feel more comfortable but the nurse aid who was taking the blood failed to do so. 

Dr. Reid was the only actual doctor I have seen there and he was great except for the part that it seems to take a month in advance scheduling to see him. Everyone else on their staff is pretty horrible. To me it seems like they may be in the wrong field because they don't care much to comfort their patients or be very attentive at all."
87,"Let me drive a Chevy through your front teeth and into a brick wall, and you'll be right where I am on the pain scale.

I just had my tonsils removed and deviated septum fixed, so I'm in a world of hurt now, but that's only because I refuse to take the Percocet they prescribed, which do a real hallucagenic number on me (last time I took them, I hallucinated I was grilling airconditioners on an open BBQ). 

That said, I can't say enough good things about the place. First, I had a great doctor and surgeon, Stacy Gray, who is not just hot, but a wonderful physician and instilled all the confidence in going through with this surgery. Second, in the pre-op room, I had a really hot medical assistant... like... yowzers hot... and even bragged to the other patients in the room around me. Third, I don't even remember making it into the operating room, cuz they jabbed me with some IV, and the next thing I knew, I was waking up in the post-op room with bandaids around my face, and a very full bladder... (and it takes quite a struggle in post-anaesthesia trying to plant your pecker into a urine bottle without making a mess).

Everything, from consultancy, to pre-op, to the operation, to the overnight post-op stay, and even the instructions on what to do after I got back home went well for me (except dealing with the mucus pouring out of my nose after trying a nasal flush for the first time..... it felt lilke a seal blew its load inside my sinuses).

Top marks in my book!"
88,"WOW! Best massage I ever had. I suffer from scoliosis and for years the middle right back muscle  has always been tense and sore. You can tell there is a bump there, with Pearl it pretty much was almost gone by the next day and my back has been feeling amazing. I will definitely be coming back every month!  Thank you Pearl."
89,Best massage I ever had. Put me to sleep like a baby. Very relaxing and perfect pressure. Foot wrap was wonderful.
90,I have been coming here for years and they are the best around! I hate going to the dentist but the staff makes it a bit easier. They are all so welcoming and make you feel at ease. Dr. John really takes his time with you and makes sure you leave with great teeth!
91,"Not quite sure how to rate this. Just want to inform folks:
I excitedly phoned Dr. Carter's office today in an effort to set up a first-time appointment after reading all the positive reviews. Unfortunately, I was notified that she is only accepting new OB patients. :-( Maybe I should.........Nah! There's gotta be another doctor out there for me. I hope?"
92,"The doctors and medical assistant here are very attentive and kind. The offices are lit with natural light and they are comfortable treating people with chronic pain conditions. Despite this, I will be seeking care at another facility. 
The main reason for this is that the front desk staff are actively unhelpful. Multiple times I have needed to get a message to my doctor and have asked for a callback. Not once has that message been passed to my doctor. There is no way to email doctors directly or get responses from them. Everything goes through the front desk. 
The final straw was having a chest X-ray ordered at another facility. I was extremely ill and was having difficulty breathing. I was told that the order would be faxed over immediately and that I should go get the X-ray. When I arrived, no order had been faxed. When I called to check on it, I was told they were doing it 'now' but an hour later there was still no Order. When I called again, the person again misled me, was rude and inaccurate in telling me she was sending it and then hung up on me. I was concerned because from 1-2 they all leave for lunch break and planned to leave me waiting sick in the imaging waiting area until they got back. No fax was sent before they closed for lunch. 
I have no way to tell my doctor this because they do not pass messages to the doctors. There is no system such as MyChart and there are also no on call doctors over the weekend. Because of this experience I no longer feel that I can get the care I need at that office."
93,"I recently moved to the area and decided to use this dentist because of proximity. My appointment was at 10:00 am, I showed up on time and was kindly greeted by the secretary. After that things quickly went downhill.

I waited for over 35 minutes past my appointment just to be taken to the back, on a particularly slow day I might add. After my check up they gave me my care plan but refused to file a claim under both my primary and secondary insurance! This is completely unheard of, considering that typical dentists are more than happy to file a claim to both primary and secondary insurance companies. Coordination of benefits is VERY common. Not here.

If you have two insurances they don't care, they demand you pay what your insurance company is responsible for and on your own time, seek reimbursement from your payer, unbelievable! 

Their reasoning behind this ""policy"",
""We're too busy to file two insurance claims.""
What a joke."
94,"I was in a car accident with my Husband driving we were stuck in traffic when a old truck rear ended us. My husband was not hurt beyond sore arms from grip on steering wheel 
I however was thrown forward then back in the seat then forward into the seat belt. My entire spine hurt upon impact!!!
So my Hero Husband who takes care of me thank God.Took me to this ER because it was closest one. He went in and told them I was injured in a car accident I use to volunteer with Red Cross and I know you are not supposed to move a injured person by putting your arms under their arms and drag them down out of a SUV into a wheelchair have them sit for 3 hours take them back pull them up out of a wheelchair then proceed to ask my husband to help me up on a high bed and leave me to cry until Dr. Stupid strolls in looking at my chart then telling me my medication LIST! 
I have had chronic pain injury to my pelvic bone area with nerve damage since 2010 with NO CURE !! that a pain management doctor treats me for so just as I am supposed to i told them and that they can't perscribe pain medication to take to pharmacy but while inside the ER pain care was fine with the pain management doctor. This is what the pain management doctor has stated. That doesn't mean Nothing for you! Here is a 5mg Norco and 2 injections of valume i a had to have one person pull me over on my side for which I kept telling them that they were HURTING ME!!
And only caused more pain I just wanted to make sure i wasn't injured!! 
So i take a lot of pain medication both narcotic and non narcotic ex Gabapentin and 8 nerve block injections to the front and back of my pelvic area because they are connected and nerve pain in this area i would wish on nobody 

So now lets add additional PAIN 1 to 10
10 
Dr Stupid is back now he comes around the bed and says "" Are you sure you were hurt in accident because your looking pretty sleepy to me"" !!! I said "" I don't know what you think sleepy looks like but I guess that's how I look when I am in shock"" he said "" Alright lets check""
I get pulled up to a sitting position and let out a howl of pain that I could not help.
He pushed around "" we will just xray your lower back if that is ok your fine. We called in 20 10mg mussel relaxer i already take tizanadine 4 mg 4 a day are you sure that is safe? Yep then leaves 
Then here comes the wheelchair again 
This time I demanded NO wheelchair 
Ok well i guess we can roll you down on the bed then I had to cry for a sliding board
Really whats wrong with you people?

By the way i was specifically telling them it's my right side that hurts.

Now the back of my head is pounding i kept asking for a ibuprofen for almost 3 hours had to keep asking for a ibuprofen for headache 
Finally i was out. 
I will never go to this ER EVER again!! 

I could have got better care at the Minor ER up the road.
But we were not sure if MRI would be needed 

My PCP sent me to ARA They were amazing 
Here we can do side and front with you standing and then we can have you step on this plate with your back against the bed ok let me strap you in. Ok now I'm going to move the bed back let me know if you are uncomfortable and I can get an assistant.
Ok we are all done. 
Hope you have as great of a Christmas as possible. I'm so sorry you got hurt.

95,"From the moment I opened the door, I was treated as a welcome customer!  The front office staff were friendly, knowledgeable, and efficient. The waiting area is open and features two screens showing a kids movie. There is a small kids area with chairs the kids loved going in and out. The staff took us back, talked with my four year old, and made her very comfortable. The entire experience was great. The office is bright, colorful, and cheerful. Everyone spoke to my daughter as the focus, because she was!  It was her first dental cleaning experience, and I'm so grateful the staff made it great for her. 

I'm not sure why this location does not have more reviews. I hope the one negative review (at the time of my posting) is not turning people off to the office.  We did not wait very long even though there were plenty of people ahead of us."
96,"I had an amazing experience with AABC.  I actually started down the conventional prenatal route with an OBGYN and plans to give birth in a hospital.  We went to a clinic that was pretty good, but I still felt rushed and like I was just a number.  I also had many friends who had bad experiences in hospitals where they felt totally out of control and that there was a lot of fear based decision making.  One of my friends had given birth at AABC and highly recommended it.  After lots of research and consultation with my husband, we decided to take the natural birth route with midwives at AABC. 

I ALWAYS felt cared for at my prenatal appointments.  I never felt rushed, I felt like all of my concerns were addressed.  When it came time to actually give birth, Vikki was the midwife on call.  She was AMAZING.  I had a VERY LONG labor that was very difficult.  I progressed so slow that I am positive that I would have been given pitocin in a traditional hospital setting.  I was in a tremendous amount of pain and I was begging my midwife for relief, and she said I could definitely transfer to a hospital to get an epidural but based on my birth plan, she knew that I didn't want that.  At that moment, I made my peace with the pain (even though I still hated it!) and I decided to stay.  Vikki was there to assist at every moment, and another nurse also came in who was an amazing coach as well.  I never cried and I was never scared that I couldn't handle it. 

The fact is, these midwives are calm and competent.  When you are in labor, and you are in pain, and you hit that point where you just want relief, it really helps to have someone there who has seen your situation thousands of times and can assure you that you are going to be just fine.  If you are sure you want a natural birth, I think it's the only way to go. I would definitely go there again!

Also, 2 days later when I was totally exhausted from the birth, they sent a nurse to my home to check on me, instead of me having to go to a clinic.  What an incredible service."
97,"I scheduled an appointment for a consultation for cataract surgery, I was told I had to wait a min. of 3 weeks for the consult because I wore contact lens.  When I showed up, a technician spent about 20 minutes doing several tests, then Dr. Gustave popped his head in the door, to shake my hand and stated that it appeared that I would not need surgery, but they could control my cataracts with corrective lenses.  Then he left.  My husband and I looked at each other and mentioned how strange that was.  The technician returned to do some more tests, then Dr. Gustave returned to the exam room to do some of the same tests that the technician had just done.  He then announced that I did need cataract surgery after all.  I was totally confused.  He said he came in and told me that I didn't need it because he thought I might be getting agitated because the exam was taking a while so he thought a diagnosis was a good idea even if it was the wrong one.  I would never let this man touch my eyes.  I also found out that I didn't need to wait the 3 weeks for the consult, the receptionist needed more training."
98,"With all the great reviews I had high hopes for the birth center. My first impression was great and I loved the atmosphere. Unfortunately I would give zero stars if I could. I went in for an ultrasound around 7 weeks and I was told I had a miscarriage and was misdiagnosed with a blighted ovum by Angela.  She prescribed me an abortion pill to clear my uterus of the ""non-viable"" tissue. She encouraged me to take it the next day without having had any blood work done or follow up bloodwork and ultrasounds which I have learned is standard before prescribing the pill and making an official diagnosis. 

Luckily I did not take the pill and for the first time in my life got a second opinion at bch the next week. They found my baby clear as day with a healthy heartbeat. 

For an entire week I was in mourning as was my fiance. We told everyone we had a miscarriage and it was hard to go back and tell them we had not. 

During the ultrasound Angela was very unprofessional as were the rest of the staff involved. It was transvaginal and the exam room led into the waiting room.. people kept coming into the room without knocking and asking to use the ultrasound machine while the midwife was in the middle of diagnosing us with a miscarriage. It felt very rushed and our midwife even took a personal phone call in the middle of all of this. 

I am now 4 months into a perfectly healthy pregnancy and I wonder how many people have been misdiagnosed here and did not get a second opinion. Their negligence very nearly killed my daughter."
99,"So my review is just based on confusion and still in pain. The clinic 5 stars...the staff 5 stars...the dentist 3 stars, just because he spent all of 10 mins with me gave me a plan but no solution. Here is the most expensive route, just let us know if you would like to move forward. Um, ok. When I went to the dentist in the past for pain it was all taken care of that day. I wasn't told well go here for a root canal (always the suggestion never an alternative) then come back for our 1500.00 crown and you'll need two. Um I don't have 3000.00 just laying around for 2 crowns I'm not Taylor Swift. So here I sit in pain I want to just drink so whiskey and knock these damn teeth out myself. I thought I did my research before taking an appointment..back to square one"
100,"This has been nothing but a nightmare since we started (Cumming office)!!  We are fortunate that we have great insurance.  However, the last two times we have been in for regular checkups they say there is a balance of $80 or $50.  Finally, we decided to call our insurance and they told us we shouldn't be paying them anything.  The insurance lady actually told me that this is potential fraud.  The insurance people tried calling billing on 5 different occasions on 5 different days.  Someone named Jessica never called our insurance back (how is she on the payroll?).  Finally, I was able to talk with a lady named Ann that did refund the payments we made.  However, guess what we just got a bill for $360 in the mail today.  We have decided that enough is enough and have transferred to modern obgyn.  We are actually considering getting a lawyer at this point especially when our insurance said you shouldn't be paying them anything."
101,"I am definitely one of those people that gets extremely nervous, anxious, and even nauseous when I have to go to the dentist. I hadn't been to the dentist since 2009, and recently one of my fillings fell out. After a while I decided enough is enough of the bothersome hole in my tooth, and with my upcoming wedding, I want a nice smile. That brought me to Dr. Karkanis. On the initial consultation, I told him of my immense fear, and that in my past experiences the anesthetic didn't work. He was very understanding, and explained all that he would be doing, and the amount of time it would take. I took my quote(I paid out of pocket), and off I went. 
My actual appointment to fix my filling was today. I was very nervous and anxious, and it only got worse as the time passed in the waiting room. The Dr. was running a bit behind schedule, but that is to be expected with any sort of medical practice. I got back into the chair, and he understood that I preferred to have the topical anesthetic before he injected the heavy stuff with the huge needle. That was honestly the worst part of the entire appointment--just the big needle going into my gum. After it was all numb, I didn't really feel anything pertaining to the drills, which is usually what I feel the most. I was very pleased with the service, and I would highly recommend, especially to someone with a huge fear or anxiety issue when it comes to dentistry(like myself!). 
If I had only one word to describe my appointment it would be: Relaxing. Honestly, it was. 

If I ever move to Vancouver, I would definitely come back to Dr. Karkanis."
102,"This review is for  Dr. Shrine John

Worst person ever! I had several visits with Dr. Shrine John over the course of a couple of months getting some customs orthotics / insoles made.  

He is an extremely rude person. Everything that I said or suggested about myself, my own subjective experience, was ridiculed by him in an extremely contentious way. Definitely comes across as the predatory type that will seize upon a situation or vulnerable person to make himself feel better. 

At one point, he was so overly involved with our exchange and not with, you know, his job, he was going to put the lift for my insoles on the wrong foot! I had to remind him that it belonged on the left and not the right as he was writing it down on the order form.

I definitely would not recommend giving any business to 
him at all.

The staff are nice though!"
103,"I must give a star to review but I would give them nothing.  I went for weight loss and ended up spending $7000 in anti-aging services (worse than the beginning). I never lost weight and every time I made an appointment for review, they charged $600. DO NOT GO HERE!  Nancy is the worst person ever!  She works off commission. The Ulthera is not certified. I learned a lot the hard way about this clinic. I was asked if I was in a car wreck after he did fillers. I had to get a surgeon to remove the fillers because they were put in my sinuses.  PLEASE do not go to this place."

Update: Response to Comments

I can fathom some explanations. And I don't have to suggest that anyone who hasn't had my experience is either suffering from a lapse of memory or inherently wrong because Dr. Shrine John is a saint to argue my case. He did and acted as I said.

Furthermore, apparently he's also a dishonorable and two-faced person who doesn't act according to principles but rather on however much he can get away with treating someone disrespectfully in a given situation who he's judged superficially to be not worth his time ; gauging his actions with people based on whether they are worthy of being treated in a dignified way or not by him. So I guess also an ego maniac."
105,"We had been struggling with nursing since birth, and it was very stressful for me and our little baby.  He wasn't gaining weight well, and I was always in pain.  We were recommended to Dr. Rosenberg around 3 weeks, and while it's only been one week since his procedure we are already noticing a big positive change. Ray is able to latch better and nurse more efficiently. The pain has subsided and I actually look forward to spending time feeding him! Thank you so much Dr. Rosenberg for your expertise and support - we are looking forward to doing better every day moving forward thanks to you and your wonderful team!"
106,"Dr. Potter is fabulously gifted and a warm human being.  I went to her after my initial reconstruction was botched.  I was so afraid I would have to go through life with one breast smaller and deformed.  Dr. Potter took all the time I needed to understand what needed to happen and what she was going to do.  10 week later I could not be happier.  Not only do my breast match but I have a beautiful belly.  
Additionally,  she wants you to be perfectly satisfied and when I explained I needed just a touch of on my hips to be symmetrical, she agreed.   It would have been easy to say "" that is all I can do"", as my other surgeon told me, when I explained I was not happy with the results.  
Austin Breast Cancer patients are lucky to have such a wonderful resource to help them on their journey to beat Cancer.  
Thanks Dr. Potter"
107,"I would not recommend SWFP to anyone. My family and I have been going there for years without any major issues until a few months ago. 

I went in to get a mole checked and the doctor said I should have it removed and tested. I am severely afraid of needles and i was barely able to calm down for the procedure. 

I never received the results and had to call them myself. When I finally got someone on the phone they refused to give me the results and told me to make an appointment. 

At the appointment they said it was benign but insisted I get extra skin around it removed just in case. So I made ANOTHER appointment to have this done.

Because my anxiety from the needles was so severe the doctor prescribed me a Xanax for my next appointment. I had never taken it before and it ended up making my anxiety 10x worse. The doctor numbed me and left the room so I could calm down down. When she came back she told me they didn't have time to finish the procedure and sent me home saying I really didn't need to have it done anyway....

I received a bill for everything even though they didn't finish the procedure. I am currently having a health advocate look into the situation and SWFP has been in no rush to answer the health advocates calls or questions.

None of my family will be going back and we have found more reliable healthcare options."
108,"I had cataract surgery from Dr. Richard Stewart. When I was rolled into the Operating Room late, Dr. Stewart was engaged in conversations with the support team in the OR. He was trying to determine why the OR was running late that morning and was looking for someone to blame. He began the surgery without ever addressing me at all to describe what he was doing and what to expect while he was doing the cataract surgery. When I finally raised my hand and pleaded with him to please talk me through his procedure while he was doing the surgery so I would know what to expect, he rudely offered to stop the procedure if I wasn't happy with his unrelated conversations going on in the OR. Surgery follow-up is not done with Dr. Stewart but is done by Dr. Lee. She apologized for Dr. Stewart's behavior and explained that he sometimes forgets that patients are not unconscious during cataract surgery. A week later, I foolishly had Dr. Stewart do my second eye. This time he made sure he spoke to me during the surgery, which I appreciated. However, when I got home and looked at the implant record cards to document the lens implants used in my eyes, they both indicate both lens were put in my right eye. I followed up with Foothills Surgery Center to obtain my medical record, which indicated the same problem, that both lens were for my right eye. Obviously this was a mistake. However it left me with uncertainty about just how deep the errors were regarding my cataract surgery. I also learned that I was the 17th of 19 surgeries Dr. Stewart performed at Foothills Surgery Center the day I had my second eye surgery."
109,"In 2015, I came to Dr Gosnell for a skin cancer screen after a work friend was diagnosed with melanoma at 37. I knew I was high risk for skin cancer because of my family history and a few incidents of severe sun poisoning. Initially, I felt like maybe she brushed my concern off a little, like maybe I had come in about a decade or two too early. I want to be clear she was very professional and thinking a young man need not worry about skin cancer was not unreasonable. Or maybe she's just easy going and I misread the situation. (Five stars and I'm still coming back so obviously she's good.)

Then she got to my back and said ""oh, what's this?"" I had a little pink growth on my shoulder. ""We're going to biopsy this right now."" Two weeks later I got the call, ""Luke, I'm sorry to say, you do have cancer."" I was a little shocked because I had convinced myself it was just a little nick from who knows what. I mean, I was only 34! I cannot imagine what might have happened if I hadn't decided to come in so early to get screened. This could realistically grown for five or more years and I'd be telling a whole different story right now.

Anyhow, I've been going to Dr Gosnell ever since and I always have a good experience. She is a great doctor, busy, and so you may sometimes have to wait a little in the waiting room. I once had to wait an hour and a half. They did acknowledge it and apologize though, which makes a difference. Recommended if you think you need screened. They also do cosmetic skin stuff but I can't say anything about that."
110,"If you are looking for good customer/patient service, DO NOT go the the Texan Eye Center at 1700 S. Mopac.  I have never been treated like this in a doctor's office.  I went in for the first time for an annual eye exam and that seemed okay other than the doctor did not provide me with a prescription. I then called their office 3 times and was promised all three times that I would get a return call the following day.  Then when I couldn't get a response about being provided a copy of my prescription, I went into the office, told them my phone experience and finally was given a prescription. What I still don't understand is how the doctor provided a prescription when he was unable to accurately exam my left eye. When I asked for an explanation, the doctor finally called a week later and left a message saying that he would call me back at some point in the future.  I'm still waiting."
111,"Dr. Neyman & Brittaney Swift are awesome.  I absolutely love and appreciate them.  

The rest of the clinic is not so great.  The office staff/management is rude and unwilling to work with you in any way.   I had a failed pregnancy that took 2 surgeries to correct.  If that wasn't traumatic enough, I have a balance on my account of which there is no way I can pay for up front but have been making payments.  I called to schedule my yearly (they sent me a text reminder) and was told I cannot schedule due to the balance.  I reemphasized that I have been making payments and it's not like I'm trying to avoid balance.  After going through several different people including the site manager the answer was still the same.  I got an ""Oh it's really good that you are making payments but because the appointment is for an annual we can't schedule until the balance is paid.""

I need my yearly appointment so I will be looking for a different doctor which is a shame because I really like the doctor here."
112,"I joined Visions Healthcare 3 months ago with very high expectations for a caring and holistic approach to my health. I have just had my first appointment with Dr Kumar and was quite horrified.
Problems.
I have been paying $33 per month whilst waiting to get an appointment which was rescheduled once without notice.
I waited in the waiting room for 1 hr.
When the nurse finally took my vitals my BP was rediculously off ( normally 110/70 now 165/80 ) I mentioned this and she just shrugged. Absoluteley no comment.
Dr Kumar was rude, judgemental, did not listen and was just plain incompetant.
I have bben having holistic care for over 40 yrs and also am a practitioner. I have never been treated so rudley. 
I went with fatigue, adrenal failure and menapausal symtoms plus stress over financial issues. Her advice: you work too hard - I'm self employed with no benefits and work because I need the money!, you need to hire help ($$$$), go to group Therapy ($$$$) Have 2 x weekly acupuncture ($$$$) have Craniosacral Therapy ($$$$) , have tests costing nearly $600, buy our supplements - again $100's of $$.
She didn't ask my about my lifestyle or medical history. Within 5 mins of meeting her she asked me why I had chosen such an odd job for my obvious type A personality. Firtstly she doesn't know me and I am so so not type A and as a P.T., Healer, Reiki Master and Muscular Therapist I was so blindsided by her judgement and lack of understanding of what i do.

Functional Medicine can be amazing if practiced properly. This is a heartless money making operation which I feel is taking advantage of people in the worst way. I cancelled my subscription immediately.

Do not go near these people. Find a good and caring Dr. If you have the time and money I am sure you are able to make the right choices for yourself re; bodywork and self care. I wish everyone luck and health in their journey."
113,"1st time customer visits are expected to be a little longer b/c x-rays and such procedures have to be preformed before the cleaning. So to expect an extra 30 minutes to and possible 1 hr appointment is reasonable. But to be at the dentist office for 2 and a half hrs and never get my teeth cleaned is ridiculous!! I saw Dr. Truong the 1st time. She was not friendly. Didn't introduce herself. And I wouldn't recommend her! After being there for such a long time and I was 'next in line' to receive my cleaning, I was nervous about waiting longer. I asked about how much longer until my teeth are cleaned and how long for the actual teeth cleaning, I was informed it would be about another hour or so! There was no way I could stay at this place for 3 and a half hours just for a bi-annual teeth cleaning. So I decided to leave as I had prior engagements. When checking with the front desk about coming back at another time JUST to do the cleaning b/c that's was all that was left to do after 2 and a half hrs. They apologized and were very nice. Rescheduled me as the 1st pt on another day! Got there right on time and there were at least 5 people called back before me. After waiting 50 minutes I was called back and seen after an hr. This time I saw Dr. Shaw. He was much nicer! But did not introduce himself either. I had to ask the names of both dentist. I was informed that I would come back and JUST receive a cleaning. Dr. Shaw examined my teeth after Dr. Truong had already done so. I understand he wants to access for himself. Then I received my cleaning. I was in the office for a total of an hr and a half this day. That's a total of 4 hrs from both visits. After my appointment I took a look at other reviews. Almost all of them said the wait time is ridiculous!! I can say the staff was very friendly the entire time. But don't go to this office unless you have TIME TO WAIT!!!"
114,"I had to bring my elderly aunt into the ER several days ago. I'm not a Floridian and the hospital doesn't rate well, but a neighbor showed me something a website that tracks the triage time. At the time, it was showing 5 min or less. 

Once you go into the ER, you scan the pt's driver's license or enter their info. We were called very shortly. This first phase covers the nurse figuring out if you're a high priority. 

10 minutes later a PA came into the waiting area to briefly confirm your complaints. 

10-15 min later my aunt went into the actual triage where her vitals were taken and it was determined she'd need a stretcher. 

 So far, I do not have any complaints. In fact, I was impressed with the cleanliness of the facility and the friendliness/ professionalism/ attentiveness towards my aunt. 

I found the treatment in the ER to be on point. The nurse was a huge help. She went above and beyond my aunts needs. 

We did wait many hours for a bed. ER's aren't too welcoming to family members, especially those with medical problems themselves. 

Once on the floor, I found her room very clean. The PCA's were very kind and I think at this point I've established there was no complaints in that department and the reason for earning 3 stars. 

The reason why this facility deserves 1 star:

After explaining that my aunt is very afraid to be there, that my aunt doesn't understand her treatments, after having dangerously low iron which leads to poor choices, after a bright note in bold, large letters with my number attached to CONTACT ME, No One Did. 

I'd leave in the evening to care for her dog and I couldn't go one day because I had to be present for a major repair in her home/I have things I deal with myself. I regret leaving her alone!!!!!

I asked about her iron levels and the number I was told differs from what's on paper. She signed authorization for a CT scan with contrast and it was not disclosed verbally the dangers of the contrast and how it has the potential to damage her kidneys further and howshe could opt out of the contrast with the understanding the test is harder to read. I never received a call about that either. 

A social worker showed up and was literally a JOKE. She was very non chalant about a discharge plan. She blurred out the company that would do the follow up and any resources she may need were my RESPONSIBILITY. My jaw hit the floor. I reminded her my aunt lives alone and cannot care for herself and was given an option to place her in a home. That level of coldness is good enough reason to fire that woman or have her move to another department not dealing with the public. I asked her for a print out of resources and she told me to write it down. She gave me one number and told me to look up the rest online. This is a fact, one of the worst states to retire is the state of Florida. They have ver poor elderly support and services. 

Discharge Day: 

I was very tired and overwhelmed. I was given a folder which had at least 10 sheets of paper. My aunt was desperate to leave so I focused on her and put the folder away, HUGE MISTAKE!!!!

My next visit was to the pharmacy. The paperwork in the folder was all about hand washing, and nothing about her major problem. Literally bullshit paperwork. There were two prescriptions and nothing for her severe anemia (which by the way I was told she was near needing a transfusion). So, I called the hospital and was told to give her iron over the counter. Ok, how much iron do I give her??????????? BTW, last dose of medications did not include iron as i now wonder: Was it everadministered to her? 

The pharmacist told me they could've called the prescriptions in and I would've just picked them up through the drive through. 

Lastly: I had to go back to the hospital because the agency nurse never showed up. The security guard takes care of this on the main floor. A case manager claimed there were Sever attempts to call and after checking my aunts phone, no calls were missed. Liars!!!! 

The case manager met up with us and she provided the agency name and that was taken care of. 

VERY IMPORTANT 

BEFORE YOU LEAVE THE HOSPITAL, MAKE SURE YOU ASK FOR A COPY OF ALL YOUR TESTS AND LABS. IT IS IMPERATIVE TO HAVE THIS INFO BECAUSE THE VISITING NURSE OR ANY DOCTORS WHO FOLLOW UP NEED TO SEE WHAT YOU WERE IN FOR. 

SADLY, THE STATE OF FLORIDA ONLY ALLOWS A SMALL FINITE NUMBER OF VISITS FOM A NURSE AND THE FOLLOW UP DOCTORS WILL MAKE YOU COME BACK ONCE THEYVE RECEIVED YOUR RECORDS WHICH MEANS A WASTE OF YOUR TIME AND AN EXTRA CHARGE TO YOUR INSURANCE. 

THE RECORDS MAY NOT REACH THE DOCTORS OFFICE ON THE SAME DAY. 

IT IS YOUR RIGHT TO REQUEST RECORDS!!!!!!!!"
115,"I wish I could give this place zero stars. Short story: DO NOT GO TO HIM--He is not worth your time, because he does not give you any of his time. They just want your money. I wonder why a person like him even is a doctor--he obviously loathes talking to people--he should be in a lab somewhere. Dr. Rasmussen is the worst experience I have ever had with a doctor. I came to write a review just in order to prevent other people from having the same bad experience. Here is my story:

I don't have bad acne. I only get a few pimples here and there on my face every so often, but I was having a little breakout on my forehead and I had never seen a dermatologist, so I decided to take the extra step and see one. I think Rasmussen literally spent less than five minutes in the room with me. Right when he came in, he immediately made a rude comment on how bad my face looked and that I needed to buy some products. I had one pimple on my forehead! It really wasn't bad at all but I thought, OK, maybe the stuff will help. I tried to get more information from him, and he just prescribed me a bunch of stuff very quickly (I remember thinking, should I actually buy this stuff? He's obviously doing a quick car salesman job trying to make me feel bad about my skin, when really, my skin is pretty good!.) I really was just stressed about having any pimples at all for my upcoming wedding. He prescribed acne wash with 10% benzoyl peroxide, cindamycin phosphate topical gel 1%, and tretinoin cream, .05% usp, all of which I bought but think were quite unnecessary for me and have not improved my skin at all--in fact, it made my skin worse. More pimples pop up after I use the acne wash and the cream makes my skin very dry (I normally have no problem with dry skin.)
 
I also asked  Rasmussen to check my moles, which I have never had checked. I have fair skin, some freckles, and a good amount of moles on my arms and a few here and there all over my body, so I thought it was important to check them--apparently he did not because he BARELY looked at me. I took the time to get undressed for nothing. He didn't actually inspect my moles--how could he have? He said I was fine but he didn't even move an inch or come near me--he couldn't see half of them by just standing in front of me a foot away! 

I literally had to say things like, ""I have one here,"" for example, in a place you cannot see, especially since I was sitting down, and he still didn't even examine. I really don't see how he could have confidently told me anything about my health or skin because he literally took less than one minute to look at me and say, ""OK."" I felt like saying, ""YOU DIDN'T EVEN DO ANYTHING!"" And now I wish I would have.
 
Another issue I had was a plantar wart on the bottom of my foot. I actually had to ask the nurse to please have the doctor come back to examine it for me because HE LEFT SO QUICKLY from my appointment without asking if I needed anything else or had any questions. Ha, if this guy has answered anyone's questions in depth, ever, I would be surprised. I think he most likely is a sexist, and I remember feeling bad for the nurses who work for him, but I won't judge too harshly, considering I only saw him for about FIVE MINUTES. 

So I asked him about the treatments for the wart, told him I had got the freezing treatment for it a year ago but  it hadn't worked, and he quickly told me he was going to freeze it. I knew there were some other ways to treat it, so I asked him if it would work and if it would hurt, and he said, ""Not really."" So he did the freezing treatment, and it was quite PAINFUL. I am OK with pain, but I like to be warned that it will hurt especially when I have to drive myself home. I could barely walk on my foot afterward and I could barely drive home (I drive a stick shift, and it was VERY PAINFUL to use my foot at all.) It was painful to walk on for a whole week actually, and the treatment didn't even work. 

The wart came back so I went back to see Dr. R and he said he thought it was gone but this time I told him no, it was still there, obviously, under the skin-YOU COULD SEE IT! So I had to go through the same pain all over again and it STILL DIDN'T WORK. Since then, I have seen a different doctor, who told me that Dr. R should have cut the skin back and done multiple treatments in order to get rid of the wart. Instead, Dr. R left me feeling hopeless, as if I would have to live with the wart forever, thinking that treatments just don't work, when in reality, he WASN'T DOING HIS JOB RIGHT. Basically, this is a doctor who doesn't care and doesn't give you the time of day, so why would you go to him? I have never taken the time to write a review about anything, but I am for this, because I care about people and I don't want them to have the same lousy experience--DO NOT USE THIS PLACE! THEY JUST WANT YOUR MONEY!"
116,"Went in for my annual eye exam. Paid my $180.00 deductible. Asked for my eye prescription on the way out & was told she could give that to me for an additional $35.00. I declined to be shaken down for an additional fee to get what I went there for. Thank god my general doctor doesn't charge me for my medicine prescriptions. Needless to say, I will be finding a new eye doctor."
117,"I can't say enough amazing things about LEXRX. First of all,  Alexa and Alex are SO knowledgeable that I was immediately put at ease with my decision to use them. Here is why I will only go to them: 

1) They are so focused on safely using filler and setting realistic expectations with me . Alexa was so careful about selecting appropriate treatment for me and EDUCATING me on what she was going to do and why. It was clear that LexRx as a company cares about the safety of their clients. 

2) It is so easy to book online with them 24/7!!! I especially love this because I have a baby at home and the thought of calling anyone during the day isn't appealing. It's so convenient for me to be able to just book online with them :) #MOMWIN 

3) After every treatment at LexRx, I can't get over just how natural their work looks. This is definitely because they are experts in their field and know exactly what they're doing. I am living in California now and fly home to Boston just to get treatments from Alexa because I wouldn't trust anyone else to make me look this natural. Living in California, you actually see so many people who are over done with fillers out here and it looks so fake. You would never come out of LexRx looking like that! 

4) Obsessed with their whole skincare line!!! Also a win that when I go for treatment, I can pick up my favorite products while I'm there.

Bottom Line: If you want someone that actually cares about you and is an expert and trustworthy NP, go to LexRx's website and book an appt! :)"
118,"Saw Dr. Ambrozic for a consult on Wharton's Jelly therapy. The session began 45 mins after my appointment time. He was in and out of the room in just 10-15 minutes, flippant with my concerns, and said some things that made me wary: 
1. That the procedure was ""100% risk free."" NO MEDICAL PROCEDURE IS 100% RISK FREE. So the alarm bells were going off. 
2. I told him I had consulted with Mayo Clinic about stem cells and Wharton's Jelly and Mayo's Regenerative Medicine Dept told me that I should be cautious, as stem cells that have not been modified to produce SPECIFIC cells could replicate damaged or harmful cells. His response? ""Well, I don't know who you talked to, but they were wrong."" 
3. He said - without having my medical records or anything - that he'd immediately start me off at a double dose. A double dose when you haven't even seen how I would respond to a single dose??? 
4. Lastly, he claimed he had treated other patients - with great success! - who had my same illness. I asked if he would please contact those patients and ask if they'd be willing to speak to me. He assured me he would, but I never heard from any of those patients. I did hear from a general neuropathy patient, who said his treatment was successful, but that patient also told me the price he paid for his services, and there seems to be some WIDE discrepancies in who pays what and how dosages are assigned (see #3) above. 
All in all, there are just too many red flags here. 
2 stars bc the office staff I spoke with on the phone was very pleasant. Otherwise I'd have gone with 1 star."
119,"I made an appointment online which they had titled ""No wait reservations"". I waited 30 minutes before asking what was going on. I was told there was still a person ahead of me.. then 2 people went back before me. Waited a total of 50 minutes before being called.

What is the point of allowing people to make appointments when they're not going to accommodate their promise? I set an appointment so I could see a doctor on my lunch break and got into trouble with my boss for returning late. 

If they were running behind they should have called me to let me know I'd be waiting almost an hour and I would have come in at a different time. 

They get 3 stars only because the staff was nice, although they could have done a better job. 

We all have schedules too."
120,"My first visit: I arrived as a new patient early to fill out paper work and whatever they needed and the receptionist told me to be seated and I'd be called back. 30 minutes went by and I watched people come and go and even saw a walk-in come in and be accepted. A walk-in for the appointment they ""no showed"" me for. So now they've double booked my PA for my first appointment - needless to say it was cut short but I loved my PA. 

I followed up a few times jumping through the hoops to get a on a biologic for my psoriasis that topicals, shampoos, diet, herbs, yoga, meditation, acupuncture, natural remedies and OTC products were't working on. I was put on Humira and began the hoop jumping to get that covered - blood work, call to insurance, call to pharmacy. 

Initial phone call debacle: I received the phone call that my blood work was WNL and I could start Humira once insurance approved it. I had a phone interview and insurance approved it with an amazingly minimal copay for my monthly supply. I called and called and called I can't even count how many times to get them to resend the prescription or whatever they had to do. I finally had to ask for the practice manager to call me to get the prescription filled. this whole process was two months. two months. 

The Humira gave me debilitating joint pain and I was immediately referred to a rheumatologist. my PA, Kristie, was AMAZING for this whole process. She was referring me everywhere to get in ASAP, she called me every couple days for an update, she started me on steroids to get my joint pain in control, she was AWESOME. She is the heroine and crowning glory of my experiences here which the only reason I've gone back as long as I have. 

Fast forward to a new set a insurance, another bad reaction to a different biologic and I decided to recheck with Kristie. She refers me to a new MD at the clinic location and offers topicals and steroid injections into the plaques to tie me over. I'll take it. The medical assistant comes in and gloves up to do my injections. My psoriasis is in varying places on my scalp and no where else. So I lay on the table and she says ""Now part your hair where your plaques are""....LADY. I can't see them...I can guess? But every other time I've had ANY therapy on my scalp injections, topical or light the MA hunts through to find them. So awkward...but I did my best. Then she sends a topical to an online pharmacy. My insurance will only allow me to fill at certain pharmacies. So I call, leave a message, the MA leaves me one back and says she'll fill it at my usual CVS. Great! I think. Nope. CVS is waiting on a prior authorization form from them. A similar issue to my Humira. I call back and leave a message for them to send that to CVS - no return call. A week later I call again asking them to send the form back (CVS has sent it twice now) and ask for a return call. I get a return call. Where she offers to send it to the online/mail in pharmacy my insurance already rejected and we discussed. She says she'll contact CVS and send the prescription to the online pharmacy. NO. I work as a receptionist so I really don't like interrupting people but home girl was straight up talking over me when I tried to tell her I just needed it at CVS. She offers me cash pricing or to fill at there after I've said my insurance only fills at certain pharmacies! By the way it's been 3 weeks and I still don't have the prescription. 

The sad part of all of this is that I really do love my PA. Kristie has been awesome every time I've been there. She's addressed my psoriasis and all other issues and she really has my best interest at heart. I don't think I can keep throwing money at this problem when the staff seems to impede any progress I ever make with my psoriasis. Currently, it's still out of control. 

I've accepted the stress is just worsening my psoriasis and I'd be better off spending my money elsewhere."
121,"I'm surprise this hospital only has three out of five stars. I had my son here in 2014. After not being able to have a water birth because I had to be induced I got transferred to Cambridge hospital. Staff from the nurses to the Doula and doctors were and are amazing. Living 
 in Boston I had a lot of people ask me why I didn't go to a Boston hospital,  because the care I have gotten with Cambridge health alliance prenatal and postnatal and the care that I get now with myself and my son is top notch! 

Not to mention I had a very easy birth compared to most. I was induced & was only in labor for 3 1/2 hours which most of the time I slept through it.

My son has his pediatrician at Cambridge health alliance her name is Jeanette Callahan and she is amazing! I feel that as a whole this hospital definitely is underrated and I think more people should know just how great the staff is at Cambridge health alliance I wouldn't go anywhere else for my health needs.=)"
122,"We couldn't be more pleased with our experience at Town Center Orthodontics! Dr. Chen has done an amazing job creating a space that is not only state-of-the-art; but feels welcoming and clean. The staff is always super friendly and responsive, and my daughter actually looks forward to her trips to the orthodontist! We were so relieved that Dr. Chen and his team took a really conservative and holistic approach to my daughters care, and didn't rush us into anything we didn't need or weren't ready for. Super kid friendly - super parent friendly - fantastic!"
123,"I really love my son's pediatrician Shonte Henderson! I wish it were enough to make me stay but sadly it isn't. The customer service and misinformation is ridiculous. The owner, a pediatrician herself is beyond rude. She had the nerves to have us wait in a room which was was hot as hell for over an hour and a half after our scheduled appointment only to rush our appointment and tell me to ""hurry up because other patients were waiting."" I was beyond upset after our visit. Thank God for change because I almost caught a case. Sadly, the entire staff has laughed about it and said ""that's just her"" while shaking their heads. It's mind boggling to think that anyone there thinks this excuse is one that is acceptable or that patients will continue to support them despite her lack of professionalism and I don't give a care attitude. 

Now Yvonne Sumlin, their Business Manager sends me a letter (instead of calling me as agreed) saying DPG doesn't owe me a refund of fees charged in excess of what the out of pocket cost are and they won't be refunded after she confirmed not once, not twice, not three times but four times that it was an oversight and I shouldn't have been charged. She even told me during our very first conversation in December she saw the credit on my account and that the funds hadn't been applied to my balances because the balance was zero so they reflected as being in excess of what was owed for the services rendered during 2015. She then told me she has told the office staff at each facility not to charge the fee when patients have Medicaid and private insurance. She kept apologizing for the errors made. Even told me she was having another meeting in a matter of a few days and would remind them again and get a refund to me immediately. Yet she kept stalling and coming up with excuses . This woman even put a note on my son's profile saying do not charge the fee and they didn't last two times!!!! Yet she sends me a letter sayings the funds were collected correctly and my balance is miraculously now zero as the funds were applied to my balance. How can that be when my balance was zero? If they were truly suppose to take the money then I should have a balance now. But thankfully I have the letter stating it is now $0.00 as of 2/4 so they can't cheat me out of any more money and I haven't seen them since 2/4. Funny thing is, the last time we talked (last week) she said she was submitting the request for a refund as a result of the overcharge amounts that day. I swear somebody doesn't know what they are doing or talking about! I guess they expected me to just take that as the gospel. Sorry but that's not how I handle business. I've done my research and I called the medical insurances and both confirmed what I already knew. They shouldn't have charged me in the first place. On top of all this, the financial summary I received clearly shows where Medicaid made the payments within a week of the service dates yet they made all the adjustments to my account on 2/4/16 where it shows a deduction for the Medicaid payment and they applied my payment. Yet they can't prove they sent the money back to Medicaid and Medicaid verified they paid the amounts in question but hasn't been credit it back by DPG. DPG is trying to double up on fees. They got paid by me AND Medicaid which is illegal and a violation of insurance laws. I knew this before I even started researching I just didn't want to believe they would try this over such a small amount of money. But then again I thought about if it is happening to me, I am sure it is happening to others who just don't understand how insurance works. Luckily for me, I am in Human Resources and I deal with my employee's insurance claims issues almost everyday. Funny thing is all of this came into question because I couldn't understand why my son's other doctors (GI and ENT) don't charge the fee so I questioned the people at DPG and I have gotten the run around ever since. Needless to say, I'll be writing a letter to the insurance commissioner to address what I believe to be insurance fraud from everything I've been told. 

 As a customer and a business owner myself, I understand the value of my dollars and my client's dollars and time. My dollars matter so I only use them where businesses are appreciative, professional, knowledgeable, honest and courteous which key DPG's employees are not. Here I am trying to support one of our own businesses... They can keep the $180. I'm over it! Decatur Pediatrics just lost a patient and will have an insurance fraud claim filed against them. I hope it was worth it."
124,"Altamonte Springs Office.  Ms. Joann Rodriguez, aesthetician, Med Spa.  I had no idea where to go. There were only stairs. There were no signs pointing to the fact that you had to go up the stairs. I figured it out for myself and went upstairs. The door was locked. I called her on her cell.  She answered, this time, and told me the door was kept locked if she was there by herself, which she was.  She came to unlock the door and when I went in, there was a waiting room and a check-in desk, with no one there (keep in mind this was 3:30 in the afternoon; a time when you would think a dermatology office would be full of patients.) She positioned me in the waiting room and came to get me (not on time) for my microdermabrasion. I was led to a dark, cramped room with boxes stacked everywhere and an aesthetician's chair. I thought I was going to a ""spa."" Not exactly as advertised. I asked for the package of 6 microdermabrasions for $600.  Ms. Rodriguez proceeded.  I was a little uneasy.  However, after she completed the microdermabrasion, I wasn't still uneasy, until she handed me a list of dermatological products that were priced $75 and up that she recommended.  Still, it didn't keep me from making a 2nd appointment for May 7 (since I didn't know what was to come"".)

Before May 7, Ms. Rodriguez phoned me and told me she couldn't make that appointment. She had a family emergency.  I understood and we texted back and forth till I rescheduled my 2nd appointment for May 14. That microdermabrasion was just like the first, no difference. I made my 3rd appointment for June 21.

Now is when the real fun started. Sometime during the second week of May I called Ms. Rodriguez  because I couldn't remember when my next appointment was.  She said she'd call me when she got to the office. After not returning any of my many calls, I decided to text her on May 31.  I was concerned and I asked her if everything was OK since she hadn't called or texted me back. Her next response, a text said simply ""Hello, your next appointment is June 21 at 2:30.""  No explanations of why she hadn't returned my calls. I wasn't happy, but I let it go and thanked her. 

On June 21 I called and asked her for a phone number of Dr. Salinas.  I said ""See you at 2:30.""  First I got ""I'm not in the office and I cannot check what your appointment time is?"" ""When I am out of the office I do not carry a computer with me to look up or schedule patients."" ""There was no way for me to figure out what happened with the appointment unless I checked the system.  What kind of professional medical spa professional doesn't have her schedule on her phone, or home computer, especially when she has another office in Clermont, where she also lives. I sent her a copy of her own text giving me the appointment for June 21. 
 
  Her response was ""I see that but I have no idea what happened until I get to the office and look at the appointment scheduler. I know I have another patient scheduled I'm so sorry something got messed up."" Then ""I messed up on the date I gave you.  I have you scheduled for June 25."" That is when I had had enough.   I said I wanted my $400 back for the 4 remaining microdermabrasions, and to credit it back to my American Express (they are pursuing a separate dispute on this issue). Now, keep in mind, it's 1:24 on the day of my appointment. Didn't hear back from her till 2:42 p.m. and her text read ""OK I'm with a patient I'll be done today at 6:30 p.m."" To make a VERY long story shorter, she said she'd refund my money and she needed my credit card #.  I said no and she said she could send me a check.  I said no check. Finally I saw no other way to get my refund than call her with my #.  The next day she credited back $350 of the $400 I was owed. When I questioned why I didn't get back the full $400 she texted that me I had a package deal of 6 for $400 and if I was cancelling the last 4 I didn't get the quantity discount. At this time I told her I wanted back the entire $600 for all the aggravation she had caused  me. That's where we still are today.  DO NOT GO TO Ms. Rodriguez at the medical spa in Altamonte Springs or Clermont. It is very unprofessional and it's more like work. You are forewarned."
125,"We had a very worrisome health situation with one of our children. I took them to Scottish Rite. The experience was professional, pleasant, and prompt. They checked us in quickly, the nurses were helpful and friendly, and they did a thorough job in diagnosing the problem. Overall, a great experience. In a time of such stress and confusion, it was a wonderful to have their help."
126,"I've been going to them for several years and have always thought they sucked but they were conveniently close, and I'm fairly healthy save some meds that I take on a regular basis. All I go in for is to get my meds refilled every 6 months!
They called the wrong pharmacy and now I've been without meds for two weeks! I need my meds dammit!
It shouldn't be this hard-they never mess up collecting my copay and billing me but the complicated world of prescription refills is apparently something that they haven't mastered.
BTW-this is the second time in three visits that this has happened.
Talked with the manager and explained what happened and asked her what she thought-she said that she wasnt in the office with the Dr and I so she doesnt know what really happened!
I told her that what I just told her was what really happened and and by saying that she wasn't in the office, she's telling me that she may not believe what I'm saying.
She didn't apologize either so huck fer!!!
New HMO-here I come!"
127,"If you need urgent care and think this place is in the neighborhood so you'll just go there... DON'T. 

Aside from it being much more expensive than its competitors, like ZOOM, its also run incredibly inefficiently.... and I mean INCREDIBLY.  The doctor on staff,  though pleasant,  couldn't diagnose her way out of a paper bag, the xray tech seemed to need to read the instructions every third film. 

When the visit was finished,  my wife and I sat in the exam room for more than 30 minutes waiting to be released; I finally had to track down the doctor who couldn't believe we were still there and she couldn't find anyone to process the paperwork.

When I paid the outlandish ticket, I asked to have both the bill and my bills emailed which they said they could do...... and of course, never happened. I went back to the facility and they wanted to add ANOTHER $47 on an already paid out bill. When I said,  ""no wayyyyyy, not another penny"" the clerk conveniently found that it a ""miscoded"" item. They did finally give me my films,  but only on a CD since for some reason they could upload that digital medium,  but not send an email. 

I wondered why they charge the office visit fee at the time of check in instead of out..... now I know,  ...no one would pay the bill. 

This is a better place for sniffles, minor bumps and bruises for hypochondriac mothers.... not someone who has a genuine problem requiring physician attention.

And btw, in case you think I am just upset with piss poor service and I don't understand the medical profession....my father,  mother,  2 step mothers,  uncle - all physicians. I grew up knowing the ins and outs of the medical world."
128,"If I could rate this hospital, they wouldn't of gotten a 1 star. My friend had a stroke. So I asked about where he was at. They said he was up in the ICU. When I got there, I told them his name. The nurse said I had to talk to the doctor. And I did. He told me. He came in with a stroke and he took a turn for the worse and that he's not going to look anything like what I knew him to be. They had to do some kind of surgery. Because of the swelling of the brain. I don't know the technical term. And he's not going to make it. I wasn't thinking about it until i got home. Why would you tell somebody that if you're not family? But anyways I went in to see him, I couldn't recognize him. Like he said . I cried and prayed over him. I'm not even religious these days. He was a Hispanic male same age same size. His face was so swollen, I don't think anyone could recognize his face. Turns out it wasn't my friend. I really wanted to go back to curse them out. He's recovering in rehab now. I think it's F'd up. Try to the think about the good things. Like I prayed over someone that didn't have anyone there. Plus to know that my friend is alive,. Going to get back to himself.   I can't say it was always a bad hospital. 8 years ago my dad had a huge heart attack. He had to go there. They took  great care of him. But that was 8 years ago. I don't know about the doctors that they have now. But with my friend... It was a very upsetting horrible, experience that nobody should have to go thru. But ya know there are always a few bad apples out of the bunch. But in that profession, you shouldn't make mistakes like that."
129,"Great setup and I love the small refrigerator with an abundance of drinks to choose from. The front desk worker was great, however I DID NOT like the doctor who came in to see me for my sore throat and earache. He was a tall, skinny, younger white man with a huge attitude. After I told him what I was initially there for and he had a chance to look at my throat and ear, he said that it looked like strep throat and an ear infection. I was thinking that I would then get a shot and some antibiotics and sent on my way home. This was not the case. The doctor then said that the nurse would be coming back into the room to do a series of tests and to take blood samples that he would send to the lab. I thought to myself why would they need any of these tests and a blood sample done if you can already see what the problem is? The nurse then came back into the room and told me what he was going to be doing, and I told him that I am declining the tests and that i'll pass on the labs and all of the extra irrelevant things that he wanted to do. He then went and got the doctor who then returned back to the room with a huge attitude and he started questioning me on why I didn't want all of these tests done. I explained to him that they were unnecessary and don't make any sense. He then started to be a smart ass and making comments about why I came to the E.R. in the first place. Very unprofessional and unacceptable. If I wasn't feeling so sick at the time I definitely would have had a few choice words for him, but I felt so bad that only told him that I didn't need his help and walked out of the E.R. room. This doctor proceeded to follow me out into the lobby of the E.R. room talking under his breath. I will NEVER be back at this emergency care center ever again. I don't care if it's the last one on earth, I'd rather suffer. I did enjoy the free orange juice though, but unfortunately his attitude and nonsense has left a bad taste in my mouth."
130,"Absolutely awful.  Do not waste your time with this practice. 

I booked an appointment for my teenager with Dr. Nicole Almeida, who their website bills as a Child, Adolescent and Adult Psychiatrist that is board certified in General and Adolescent psychiatry. 

I spoke with someone in their office at length, giving them all our background information including date of birth. Received several confirming appointment emails. 

The day before the appointment I logged onto their patient portal and a message flashed up saying ""this appointment has been canceled."" I called the office, and the person I spoke to was entirely unhelpful. They claimed that they had sent me a message asking to reschedule (which they did not). I told them we have been waiting for weeks and asked what the first available appointment was with any available practitioner. They would only tell me that everyone was booked up for the next couple of weeks. 

I asked for their practice manager to call me. She was entirely unhelpful in finding me another appointment. I asked her why the appointment had been canceled in the first place, and she told me that they had canceled the appointment because my daughter is a teenager and  Dr. Alameida does not see children!"
131,"I've wanted to write this review for a long time, but I've been hesitant to do so under emotional duress.

Its been about a year since I came to touchstone to have my mri with contrast (brain). Overall I had a pleasant experience with staff. They were friendly, punctual, and organized. It was also the most affordable mri I could find. 


My issue is not with the facility or staff, but with the contrast agent used in MRIs called Gadolinium. Before getting the contrast you need to sign a waiver that says that patients with kidney problems can have issues clearing Gadolinium out of their bodies.

I had just had a physical and blood tests showed kidneys were working perfectly. But 4 hours after my MRI, my hands and feet started burning (they've never done this before in my 30 years of life).

The burning got progressively worse until it felt like someone was pressing hot irons against my skin. This persisted day and night for 45 days. 

As I did research I found out there are thousands of people who have had much worse and much more severe and debilitating symptoms from Gadolinium than I did. People who went from perfectly healthy to bedridden for over a year, and people who have had a dozen or more of these injections and suffer decades of pain as a result. 

There is a serious issue with the medical industry in that they'll jab you with anything they doesn't harm the majority of people, but you're not a majority, you're just an individual and you may be among those that ends up with Gadolinium stuck in your body for a long time. 

To give some more context, the techs told me I'd pee it all out within a day. But do a little research and you'll find that Gadolinium binds to muscle, bones, organs, and even your brain and never leaves. They figured this out over 10 years ago while doing autopsies but they're still using the old scripts. 

Just be careful. The mri showed absolutely nothing that the doctor was looking for. Be skeptical of your doctors too. They're only human. I spoke to a radiologist later and he told me there was absolutely no reason to get the contrast for what they were looking for, and that essential sequences were left out of the scan.

The recommendation for mri came from a neurosurgeon. Don't let a neurosurgeon tell you what only a radiologist should be able to tell you. It's dumb. I learned the hard way."
132,"Very dishonest! I came for my first visit, which did not consist of an examination, only of Dr. Cody telling me that I needed x-rays. The administration staff sent me to 3 different locations to get my x-rays done, but every location said that they did not preform that specific x-ray. Finally the 4th location confirmed that they in fact preform the x-ray, but they didn't accept my BCBS insurance. 

I returned to Peachtree Spine Physicians on Peachtree Dunwoody Road a few days later, with my x-rays, only to be told I would be charged for a whole new visit. I informed the front desk clerk that I was not willing to pay for the second visit especially since no services were rendered on the first, and that I had been sent on a wild goose chase to get x-rays that should have been a prerequisite for the initial appointment. I reminded the staff that I had come in just a couple of days ago and was advised to get x-rays, that cost me $500. I also informed the clerk that I was unwilling to pay for an additional visit when I had received no services for the first visit. I told her that if I were to be charged again I would rather cancel the appointment, because I didn't think it was fair to be charged again seeing as though no service were rendered in the initial visit. She called billing and they both agreed that I would NOT be charged for the second visit and I agreed to speak with the doctor about the x-rays. Two weeks later I received a bill for the second visit! Dr. Cody's administration team is dishonest and the entire office is designed to get all the money that they can out of you. Needless to say I would not trust this office. They are one of the reasons why healthcare insurance is so high!"
133,"Dr Pace, Thank you for your professionalism, your office performed above and beyond. Excellent!! Best of luck."
134,"Update: Well, I received a bizarre letter today from Westgate skin & Cancer letting me know I've been ""dismissed for defaming or negative commentary, abusing staff, and breaking their policies."" Fascinating, albeit disturbingly false rewrite of the facts and reality. So strange. 

I can only assume that they read my previous review from 3/14/19 and this ""dismissal"" form is how they chose to respond, though I'm perplexed by the notion that you can dismiss someone who already left and found another provider. (This sort of feels like receiving a breakup letter from your ex, months after you called off the wedding, told everyone what he was really like, moved out and moved on, and then months later he writes you a letter & accuses you of doing to him what he actually did to you in the relationship.) Again, so strange. 

I clearly indicated several months ago that I would not return to their practice after the railroading, bullying, gaslighting treatment I received from Daniel (""Founder"") when he attempted to pressure me into signing several of the new policies they'd recently implemented, so the point of this form letter seems rather moot to say the least. 

Call me sentimental, but I miss the good old days when it was considered best practice for businesses to reach out in the spirit of goodwill and attempt to make things right with customers who'd had a negative or upsetting experience with their staff or business. Oh, well. C'est la vie... 

After the shocking and somewhat traumatic experience I had with Daniel (""Founder"") in March, I wrote my review, then happily moved on and found a wonderful derm practice that is a much, much better fit for me.  I feel valued as a patient/customer by every staff member I've come in contact with (i.e.,I haven't been bullied or railroaded or gaslighted.), my rights as a patient/consumer have been respected, and there are no outrageous demands or policies (that could leave my data and credit card vulnerable to a potential security breach, or gag clauses that infringe on my consumer and first amendment rights.) that one must agree to in order to be customer/patient. All is well. 

This has truly been the most bizarre and unnecessarily negative experience I've ever had with a business, medical or otherwise. Anyhoo... Good luck, friends, and remember: Honesty is always the best policy; kindness (definitely) matters; we're all entitled to our own opinions, but not our own facts.

Note to the business: 

Clear communication is extremely useful and important. Perhaps a more respectful, productive, and less dramatic path going forward would be to simply communicate to established patients/customers that your policies have changed since their last visit when they schedule their appointment with your office, and not wait to inform them until they arrive for their appointment. 

It's best not to assume that your new policies will work for everyone--ESPECIALLY people who began with your practice when they weren't in place. No one is required to sign anything that they don't feel comfortable with or agree to-- that is a basic right as a patient/consumer.  Assigning arbitrary labels like ""breaking policies"" when a person has exercised their basic, legally protected consumer/patient rights and declines to sign new policies (that you failed to inform them about​ and present a certain risk that they are uncomfortable with.) demonstrates an alarming lack of respect and understanding of those rights. 

Your office did an excellent job of requesting my credit card information in order to hold my appointment in March--that would have been the perfect time to also inform me that your policies had significantly changed and that I would be asked to sign new forms upon arrival. With that new information: I would have simply educated myself about your new policies; contacted your office and communicated my unwillingness to go along with certain aspects of the new changes ahead of time and (I assume) I would have learned quickly learned that there is no middle ground, therefore, not a good fit and simply canceled my appointment (and found another practice with policies that work for me, which I have.)

Finally, it would also be prudent to make sure that everyone in your front office knows what your policies actually are in order to prevent future situations like what I experienced. I indicated (before my appointment.) that I was not willing to give your office my credit card to permanently keep on file (after going through the ordeal of three credit card/information breaches/hacks with different companies last year!!) to the young woman I spoke to when I called back and provided to hold my appointment, but that I would happily give your office my credit card information when I scheduled each appointment-- she indicated that what I'd suggested would be absolutely fine. Clearly, that was not an accurate representation of your office policy. 

Best of luck."
135,"I have never felt so disrespected and neglected by a doctor's assistant. I came here with a fractured ankle in mid-June. Dr. Hyde was amazing. She did my surgery on 6/26 and it went as well as I could imagine a surgery going. Dr. Hyde knew I was going to be moving out of state to California so she was very thorough by giving me a CD with follow-up appointment x-rays, my initial surgical film x-rays and information for me to give to my new doctor in California. I left on 7/8 feeling confident and like things related to this surgery would be alright for me and my partner. WRONG. The reason I am writing this review is because of a conversation I had today with someone in her office. I say, ""someone"" because she did not tell me her name when she answered the phone. I called yesterday and left a voicemail explaining that no one has been willing to see me since I have arrived here in CA. Either no one will take on someone else's surgery, or if they do - they won't accept non insured. So there I was, after two weeks of discouraging searches and one extremely terrible Dr. visit (that was not willing to prescribe any medication to me after having an x-ray and consult) desperate to speak with the office I trust in hopes they would help me. ""Wow"" is all I have to say. I left a VM on the after hours line explaining everything. I woke up today thinking I would get a call back, ya know, because I am a patient who had surgery a month ago? No call. I called back at 4:08pm CST and this person answered the phone. I said hello, my name, and I left a voicemail yesterday... then cut off. ""Yeah, you did. I called you back this morning."" Oh, well that's weird, I have been waiting by the phone working all day. ""Yeah, went straight to voicemail. ANYWAY, something about you can't find a doctor who will see you because you had surgery here? Yeah, most doctors WON'T. I don't know what to tell you. As for the medication, Dr. can't send a prescription across state lines. Maybe you should try and find a primary care physician or just go to pain management."" This woman just told a surgical patient, who hasn't seen a real doctor since 7/8 when STAPLES were removed, to go see a primary care or pain mgmt. doctor? I was shocked. I explained that I have known of folks, and have myself, gotten a prescription from one state to another. ""No, that does not happen. Not for pain meds. Maybe an anti-inflammatory or something but not pain meds."" I tell her, it was for pain meds- narcotic pain meds, and two different ones. It was not that long ago (2017 when at my mom's funeral). ""WELL, WE don't do that because even sending something like Tramadol does not work as we have tried it this year. I'm sorry, ok, I don't know what to tell you. I mean, you can fly here from LA, (she LAUGHED) but that sure does seem like a long and expensive way to go for a prescription. Otherwise, best of luck."" Now, I understand DEA regs and laws as it pertains to needing paper scripts for certain meds. I also know that I trusted this practice more than I have EVER trusted a doctor in my life. The care and attention I received from Dr. Hyde herself was beyond incredible, I thank HER for that. However, I do NOT appreciate being talked to like a child. I do not appreciate being treated like a burden by her staff. I am out of pain meds and in A LOT of pain, swelling and discomfort STILL. I went ahead and called two pain management clinics in my area to hear the same thing from both: ""Wow, that sounds odd. Do they not have the ability to send Tramadol electronically? Yes, we send our patients prescriptions electronically all the time if they are traveling for work or vacationing because things happen. Aren't you an established patient of theirs? So, technically you don't need a doctor- you have one that won't help you. Well, you can come here but it's 500-700 dollars each visit- no insurance accepted."" I am a reasonable HUMAN BEING and I totally understand if that is not her policy or if that is something she cannot do, but hearing it the way she said it? The audacity of her to be so cold and heartless to AN ESTABLISHED PATIENT-JUST THERE NOT EVEN A MONTH AGO? I guess I'm not important anymore because I moved for work? That woman doesn't know how to treat or talk to people. She is incredibly rude, dismissive and cold. If you have ANY issues and call in (I couldn't handle the initial meds and called for something much weaker to my stomach. She, almost positive, asked me 12 different questions-things I had already told her, talked over me and was incredibly mean in her responses, made me feel crazy for needing different meds 6 DAYS after surgery) she will make you feel like a bother, give you zero explanation for her overly inquisitive/ PA demeanor. I am now SOL, feel like I shouldn't have moved and I miss the comfort/peace of mind Dr. Hyde provided. I am beyond heartbroken that this is how I was treated in the end. Just be aware- that woman is MEAN and doesn't want to help you."
136,"I was looking forward to having a reading with Tarek; I've been in the midst of a lot of life changes and liked the positive reviews I'd seen on him.  It seemed like he'd be a good person for straightforward feedback that's pretty accurate.  

I scheduled a phone reading with him online and he confirmed via email.  I ended up with a conflict and needed to reschedule, which we did via phone and text.  I called at our scheduled time--no answer.  Called again; no answer.  Texted; no response.  No response to a call and text the following day.  The guy just dropped off the face of the earth.

I don't like giving negative reviews, but this was just really unprofessional.  Perhaps more importantly, I'd want to caution anyone about paying in advance for a session.  There's a function for this via his website, but I had a gut feeling I shouldn't use it, and now I know why.  If you try to book with him, don't give your payment info until you're on the phone (or in person) for your reading, otherwise you could get hosed.  Best of luck."
137,It's a good start but I don't believe I will need to reschedule. I do wish you continue to thrive and best of luck.
138,"It's taken me a while to write this review but I wanted to share my experience from December of 2016 so other patients are aware and know when to seek a second medical opinion. While Dr.Guerra demonstrated a sincere empathy for me as a patient I did not agree with her medical recommendations and review of my test results. I no longer go to Dr. Guerra and cannot recommend her. Read below for details of my experience.

I received a voicemail from her office assistant stating my lab work had tested positive for Tuberculosis. I called back and the office assistant stated I needed to wait for a follow up. Because the office assistant did not understand the severity and implications of this infectious disease, I insisted I speak with Dr.Guerra immediately. Dr.Guerra called me back a few hours later and referred for a chest x-ray to confirm an active or latent infection.  I waited 4 hours for confirmation that I did not have the active form of Tuberculosis and Dr.Guerra recommended I start a 9 month course of antibiotics. Meanwhile, I also spoke with my father-in-law who is a retired ER doctor to get a second opinion and he encouraged me to get a second blood draw before starting a 9 month course of antibiotics and putting myself at risk for a multitude of side effects. I went to the lab and asked for a repeat test without the permission of Dr.Guerra. Once the second test results came in, the office assistant asked why I had additional blood work done, not that it was her business. I asked for a copy of all of my results, including the first round of labwork. It turned out my first round of labwork was a false positive! The results from lab corp explicitly stated I should get retested as this was likely an error. To no surprise, my second labwork was a confirmed negative. I was so incredibly frustrated that I had exposed myself to radiation due to this frivolous oversight. I talked to Dr.Guerra about this and she still insisted I continue to take the antibiotics ""just in case"". I was baffled and asked to be referred to a specialist. The infectious disease specialist did not understand why Dr.Guerra would make such a recommendation and cleared me as both the second lab work and chest x-ray were negative. In summary I cannot recommend Dr.Guerra, she lost my trust completely and is no longer my primary care physician. I've learned, always get a second opinion and ask for any results in writing. Hope this helps someone who reads it, best of luck."
139,"Updated Review:

I appreciate the response and would like to comment. I have worked in both private and non-profit medical and mental health facilities, this financial policy is not a standard in this industry. I have a hard time with the comparison of a car rental or hotel, to healthcare. In fact, I weep at that analogy. I have worked on legislation to help increase Medicaid wages for healthcare providers and am well-versed on insurance contracts and HIPAA regulations. I, most certainly, do not need to be ""mansplained"" about it. 

I would also like to point out that this policy was not disclosed in its entirety until after my appointment. I'm curious about what industry asks for a credit card to be authorized for an undisclosed amount. Perhaps, more transparency would have eliminated this issue all together. 

Best of luck.


Review the financial policy very carefully!!!

The staff was friendly, and making a new patient appointment was easy. I filled out my paperwork on line and thought I was all ready to go. I get to the office and am asked to sign a waiver to leave a credit card on file. I inquired about this and was told that the card could be used for a balance that my insurance didn't pay, etc. I wasn't very comfortable with this and explained that I prefer to check my EOB's to make sure everything is processed. It was implied that this was not an option to waive, and I would have an opportunity to discuss with them prior to my card being charged. I, reluctantly, signed. 

Two days later I get an email stating that I had authorized them to charge up to $1500.00! Wait, what??? 
It stated I have an option to withdraw my authorization, so I emailed and ask for that to be taken off my record, and to find out how much I would owe at my upcoming procedure. I get a reply that if I take my card off file I am required to pay their self-pay rates, even though I assigned my insurance benefits to them, and was ready to pay the contracted rate at the time of service. I am a healthcare administrator and have never seen any other office handle collections in this manner. I guess they don't trust that their patients can pay the bill, very likely in River Place. 

Bottom line, money is what matters. This is an infuriating policy that puts their pocketbook over patient care. 

I liked the doctor, she was friendly and helpful. But, this is not the type of office that I can give money to."
140,"I have gone to Dr Roberts when she was in Dermatology practice.  I had made an appointment, waiting over 2 months to get in, for this March.  I was sent a link to fill out paperwork with Nextech.  Upon reading the Terms and Conditions of Nextech I didn't agree with their ability to track what I was doing and sell my information to Nextech clientele for advertising.  Basically, they add cookies to my account, what I click on would shows up in ads on their site directed towards my interests from their advertisers and much more.   I didn't want to do this and in Nextech paperwork it says to contact the provider.  I did that to get a better understanding of Nextech and my privacy.   Low and behold NOBODY at Dr Roberts offices has EVER read the terms and conditions therefore had no answers or alternatives for me.  Two days of waiting.  Finally they call me and said they were transferring me to the Business Manager, who never picked up, went straight to voice mail. THEY CALLED ME! When I called right back all my calls went to voice mail.  I have canceled my appointment and will go elsewhere.  Two reasons, lack of knowledge of patient privacy (you have to manage your own account, as it says in the terms and conditions) and lack of alternative choices.  When canceling, it never mattered why, there was no concern of how we could help to keep you, it was more of the attitude, ""Oh, Okay...it is canceled"".  Fine, you are so lucrative you don't need my money or references, that is fine.  Best of luck."
141,"This is our second go-around with IVF and the office of Dr. Moghadam. The entire first experience, as difficult emotionally and physically as it was, was made so much better because of Dr. Moghadam and his staff at the north office. We chose his office after he was recommended by another local, and very prominent, OBGYN. Then we did our own research, and he had the highest success rate of any other fertility place we saw. I loved almost everyone at the office, and we felt more of a part of a little family than just patients at some doctors office. I can't imagine going through a process like this without having a doctor and staff who you feel care about you and the result, and feel sorrow with you when things don't work out. 

I had endometriosis, which apparently led to these fertility issues. We first went through two rounds of IUI. The second one worked, but was ectopic (super sad), and led to surgery. The surgery center that the office uses is great, especially compared to my experience at the big hospital next door. It's intimate and calm, which was a relief, and the staff over there was caring and kind as well. Dr. Moghadam is a good surgeon, and I have no lasting evidence of the surgeries.

After the IUI, we decided to do IVF. It's quite the process, but we ended up with four great embryos, and the first two gave us a perfect baby girl! The last two we will use this next month.  

Overall, we are very happy with the efforts of Dr. Moghadam. We (I) tend to use a lot of humor during difficult times (and there are a LOT of uncomfortable and awkward things to laugh about during this process), and he laughs with us. He can be cut and dry with the facts, but he is caring and good at what he does. I don't need a lot of hand-patting and sweet words, but I do need my doctor to care, and my husband and I know that he does. He checked on me after surgery, and took time to answer our questions and talk through decisions when we needed it. After our new baby was born, we invited him to come see her in the hospital, and he did. 

If you're reading this, I know you're probably already going though an emotional time and decision. We recommend Dr. Moghadam and his staff and wish you the best of luck. Our prayers are with you."
142,"What a terrible experience!

I visited for the first time this week and walked into my appointment on time. The first thing I was told was ""Oh, he's running late right now so it'll be a few minutes."" I asked how far behind he was running and was told ""15-20 minutes"". An hour later I was still in the waiting room.

A nurse finally called my name and brought me back into an exam room where I sat for another 20 minutes. When the doctor finally did come in, I felt extremely rushed. He asked me a very fast set of obviously scripted questions and was prescribing me 6 (yes, SIX) medications AND a birth control pill within the first 60 seconds he was in the room.

I had no opportunity to voice my concerns whatsoever, one of them being that I didn't want to be put on a whole slue of prescriptions. He was very matter of fact and very impersonal. Once I was able to get a word in for myself, I asked him not to place the order from the prescription as I would not be filling them and left.

I will never be back and would encourage others to consider how personal you want YOUR appointment to be. I was treated like nothing more than a piggy bank and saw nothing but dollar signs anywhere in this practice.

Best of luck."
143,"This is a factory. When my husband and I went in, we got the same dumb nonsensical thermostat analogy that I am sure is given to all patients. Questions about alternative protocols and various supplements are quickly and condescendingly glossed over. Don't expect any out of the box thinking here -- so, if you are not textbook, you might want to do some additional research. And don't get me started on the billing office where the woman I was talking to seemed to have the IQ of my sock. She suggested that I and my GYN didn't know that BIVF only provided infertility services not fertility services. It's a long story, but they were well aware of my medical diagnosis (which was not infertility) before I made the appointment. Maybe, just maybe somebody didn't read my file... 

Long story long, I took the supplement cocktail that is listed on one of the fertility boards recommended by the top RE doc (Dr. Schoolcraft) in the country, started acupuncture with a FABORM certified practitioner, got a sprinkling of miracle baby dust from my recently departed mother, and I am now seven weeks pregnant. Different things work for different people. Make sure you do your homework, and make sure you feel like you are in good hands. Trust your maternal instincts.

Best of luck."
144,"Dr. Cain- I am not a ""coward""  I did call your office multiple times to complain. I even paid $25 dollars for after hour care only to have you scream at me for waking you up. This is not a slam on your intelligence.  Your credentials speak to that alone.  I am glad you realized that epilepsy is not something you wanted to focus on.  The other disorders that you treat may be much better suited to your passions and maybe your bedside manner has changed.  Do not imply I did not try to reach out... I most certainly did. My response was finally a letter telling me you were gone.  Thank you for sending your epilepsy patience to Dr. Aboumater.  He is extremely passionate in treating epilepsy.  He did things for me that you had never even done like a 3 day EEG. Really Dr. Cain? I did not even know that existed and I saw you since I was 12.  I do not want to argue so this will be my last response.  I am glad you have loyal trusting patience in which you are treating successfully.  Best of luck.

Also-  I have NO clue what you mean by false name...  Maybe I am under my maiden name in your system which is KANAR YOUSEF.  Not sure how many ""Kanar's""  you have, interesting. Yes- I am not a coward and have nothing to hide- look at my chart, please do.  Again- you have always refilled my scripts on time. Not the issue.  I actually found your staff quite helpful. I am reviewing your manners and ( now understanding) your lack of passion to treat epilepsy as you did not even give me a 3 day EEg which is apparently the first thing you do.  As you can see from my profile I am not malicious. I am not out to get anyone.  I just really wanted other people with EPILEPSY to receive the best care possible.  It seems now that is not your specialty as I see your great ratings are not seizure control.  Cheers."
145,Should have updated this a while ago. Good on them for reaching out after new management took over. Best of luck.
146,"I was also a Groupon customer. After a lot of talk about wanting a massage, by boyfriend bought this Groupon and gave it to me as an early birthday present. I called ASAP, anticipating a big response (an hour long massage for $25 is pretty awesome). They told me that the waiting list was currently around two months, and to email with my availability and they would respond with some times. Apparently they only had one massage therapist, but were considering hiring another.

I figured it would only take a few days to hear something, but it actually took weeks. The times given to me as options did not reflect the information I gave them, so I waited a while and called them again. All I got was a voicemail message that said if I was calling to schedule a massage purchased with Groupon, they would not be taking any more appointments at this time. The Groupon expires in September, so I guess I'm going to need to get my money back.

This place might actually be alright, but I wouldn't know it, and I'm not going to try to find out. If you only have one massage therapist, don't do a giant Groupon sale."
147,"I have gone to Dr Cory Griffith for 12 years. I love him and he's the best. This review isn't about him.


I just called to try to make an appt. His receptionist Kelly was soooo rude.
Mind you, I have two babies. A TUMOR IN MY BRAIN. Im in menopause at 36. I have A herniated disc making it nearly impossible to walk or lift right now. And a foot I can barely walk on (the reason why I called to be seen)
I realize this is all my problem. Yep, I get it.
When I tried to explain to Kelly that because of all the aforementioned reasons, there's no way I can make it to 8am appts with my babies in tow, pretty much ever, she was so rude. Acted like I was a primadonna. I explained that I have been seeing Dr Griffith for 12 years and did not mean to inconvenience her by calling to attempt to schedule an appointment. I ended up in tears and ending the call as soon as I could. She very rudely explained that she's 'the easiest person in the world to work with and what was my problem' ?!?!?

Maybe she was having a bad day but I can guarantee my day, week, month, year has been worse.
I'm sad because I absolutely love Dr. Griffith, always have, we have rapport and he would confirm that. It's a shame."
148,Fuck this place for wasting my time and taking my money. Stupid ass woman didn't know what she was talking about.
149,"I have never gotten acupuncture before and was super nervous about getting it done. I went to Danielle and she has changed my life. I was getting migraines and back problems and they have gone away since I saw her. I never thought how powerful acupuncture could be, but Danielle has made me a true believer. I highly suggest you go here. From the front desk always greeting me with my name and the environment being so relaxing Portland Healing Space is where I go for my chiro, massage and acupuncture. I feel like a new women thanks to this amazing staff.  Go treat your self and go. You won't be disappointed."
150,"Dr. Perloe treated my horribly - his behavior is unacceptable and I left this office in utter disbelief about how I was treated here. 
I tried to keep this short, but there was so much wrong with this practice this is the best I could do. I've never had such a terrible experience with a doctor. To top it off, they don't validate parking, so in addition to the two hours I wasted in taking time off work, I had to pay money for the horrifying ordeal. 

- I had an appointment Dr. Perloe and had to reschedule a few times because of a family emergency.  It consistently takes 15+ minutes to reach someone by phone. The calls are routed through Maryland and it's a whole ordeal. They cannot answer anything beyond scheduling. 

- When I got to the office for my first appointment, i was told I they scheduled me as a follow up and not a new patient. When they looked at my record, I was told the appointments I rescheduled were never cancelled and I was marked as a ""no show"" for all of them. 
- I was confused, but to me it was very obvious there were mistakes in scheduling on their part (despite the fact that I was very clear on the phone and called weeks in advance), so I expected they'd honor the appointment I had. However, they said Dr. Perloe refused to see me that day.  I was pretty understanding, but pressed a bit because 1) it was their mistake, 2) I'd waited weeks to be seen, 3) I drove 45 mins to get there 4) I knew I wouldn't take anywhere near the hour they said they needed for new patients (I just needed a new prescription provider after moving), and 5) The waiting room and was empty and the office was clearly not busy. 

- When I tried to reschedule, I was very restricted. They only accept new patients in the mornings 3 days a week. My schedule is VERY open. I'm available every weekday afternoon and all day Fri-Sat. They had plenty of open time, but not for my ""kind"" of appointment. I was dumbfounded they refused to be more flexible. 

- A sympathetic nurse overheard and offered to speak to Dr. Perloe since I had a straightforward situation. She got him to agree to see me and I filled out the necessary paperwork. 
When I went to give them to the desk, Dr. Perloe came by and yelled through the doorway ""I'm not seeing her. Not now and not ever!""

I was absolutely horrified. It was so incredibly rude, cruel, and childish. No one knew what to say. He angrily mumbled something about missed appointments as he went back around the corner. I explained to to the nurses it wasn't my mistake, and asked if there'd be call logs or recordings from my calls. They said yes, but couldn't see any of them. I was on the verge of tears so I just thanked them and left. 
 I'm not an emotional person but I started crying as soon as I got into the hall. It was an appalling way to treat someone - I haven't had anyone speak to me that way in years - especially in a professional setting. He is the absolute opposite of what a good healthcare provider should be."
151,"If you have bad feet the ""Good Feet Store"" is not the solution. Seeing the great advertising for how wonderful  they are on TV.  I got a gift certificate and thinking ""WOW"" this is going to be great! My feet will be wonderful. Me never one to complain about anything.... but this time I do have to say my 2 cents. If you have Plantar Fasciitis  this is ""NOT"" the place for you. The help was very friendly and kind. The cost was outrageous $350 dollars later for a pair of insoles ( the certificate didn't come close to cover that)  The prices on things were a mystery...nothing is marked. The insoles made everything worse. I was either slipping around in my shoes or they were so tight in other shoes, that I couldn't' get them on. My Plantar Fasciitis  got worse. I went back in and got another set of insoles hoping that would help. Still nothing.... got even  worse results...where I had to get my doctor to write me a prescription  for something just to tame the pain  and take the swelling down. I didn't want to be a pill...but I finally got enough nerve to call them and explained to them the situation. They were very happy to take them back and nice to me again.....but you don't get your money back and you just get in store credit. I went back again and ended up with a couple of pairs of shoes that were so highly over priced. They may help some one with back pains but if you have foot issues you may want to think twice on this and along your pocket book. The help is great but the company itself is very misleading."
152,"I booked this appointment thinking that it would a great way to relax on my Birthday.  

When I arrived I was greeted by a polite man. The establishment was clean but did not have the high end spa feel I was hoping for. No tile, cheap inset shower stall and minimal personal products. When I asked for hair tie I was given a rubber band. No makeup remover or hair brushes.  

I found the intro/explanation of everything rushed and I did not catch on that was suppose to shower before the float until after I got out turned on the lights and saw a sign instructing me.   

All these little things are really no big deal I'm not one to complain. BUT... The ear plugs provided were cheap Stanley ear plugs, the foamy kind that help protect your ears from noise not water! 

I needed to stop floating 3 different times to adjust the plugs. After each adjustment I could hear the water slowly coming in again. With no other senses to compete with this sensation, it became extremely    irritating. The last time my ear filled up with water I gave up and got out early.  

When I explained that I did not enjoy my time due to the ear plugs, I was given no empathy. No "" I'm sorry"", or ""is there anyway we can make it up to you"". Not even a discount, he actually continued to sell me a package deal! 

Nope! 
Never again! 
Waste of money!"
153,"Update, I am sad to say that after so long i have to change my rating.  When i needed to see her most i was 15 late for my appointment they refused to see me and when i argued this with the staff i was kicked out of her practice.  So when a front staff person can kick you out of seeing a dr and also from the practice itself after 7 yrs that is a BIG deal!! To have all your medical records and appointments and have to start over because i argued with them over the phone!!! Not just that but I even kept getting rescheduled endlessly so when i have to redo my schedule because bank is on vacation and then i show 15 minutes late and she can't give me the same in turn after being a loyal patient this was unmanageable!  It takes MONTHS to get an appointment NEVER AGAIN!!!


CONS:
The office staff is horrible.  I am soo surprised that a bunch of intelligent Dr.'s would allow an office to be run the way it is.  The nurses that i encounter do not have a good attitude with the patients.  They are very monotone when speaking with you. Very quick and short and tend to complain about things like not having supplies available.  I have yet to get a call back the same day with a concern i have. it's usually 24-48 hours later and i have to call Rose back and remind her i called and to please call me back.

Checking out is difficult as well.  The woman is rude and never has a smile on her face. She barely makes eye contact with you and is rude when you ask her questions.  I have been in the office a bit and that is my same experience with all the people there.  Adrienne the referral woman is not helpful either.  I ask her questions about the test and how i make the appointment and she snaps the orders at me like i am suppose to know what the tests are and exactly how to say them and i should know exactly where i am going.  The staff fails to understand that just because they know, doesn't mean us civilians do.

I tolerate her staff because I like Dr. Banks, but my last visit may change some things.  I didn't like being paraded around the office with my gown and no clothes on. I asked the nurse for another gown to cover my back but she retied it and said i would be fine. She then took me and another man who followed behind me to get X-Rays on the other side of the office. I could feel the air on my back so i knew it was open and i didn't like how uncomfortable i felt in that paper thin gown sitting inches away from the man waiting for X-Rays.  I thought that was highly inappropriate!  

The office is somewhat clean but it appears to be an older office and decor is none. I know petty but just an FYI.  This practice has a lot of Dr's as well so have your pick. Hope this helps out a little"
154,"I have tried calling at least 4 different days for an appt. during business hours probably 5-10 times a day and nobody ever answers the phone or returns my messages.  Extremely unprofessional and no way to run a business.  Too bad I bought a non refundable deal and will be forced to go here and give this unprofessional ""business"" my money.  If I still can't get in contact with someone I will dispute the charge with my credit card.  Never have I been to a salon/spa or any business for that matter who never picks up the phone.  NEVER AGAIN!"
155,Please save your teeth and money v abd stay clear of Greenberg dental!  Especially the aloma location!!! I am a regular that get teeth clean every 6 months according to my insurance.   I had  been going to this place for years abd not once did they tell me I had cavities.  The latest and last visit freaked me out because I didn't observe the dental assistant open a new pack of utensils! I found a new dentist who is awesome!!! Dr. Maxine montcrieffe!!! Upon my first visit to her they discovered I had 11 cavities!!!! How could this be when I went regularly to greenberg?? Take my advise and stay away!!!! They just do bear minimal and bill your insurance like crazy!  Never again!!!!
156,"This place is awful.  They don't care about wait time.  Expect not to be seen for at least 45 minutes after your scheduled time.  They reserve too many people....I even had to wait in line just to sign in.   Staff is rude.   If you have a choice, do not use SimonMed. Horrible.  Check out the other reviews for other locations (wish I had).  Seems this company is bad across locations.  Never again!"
157,"I am EXTREMELY  UPSET with this place . Been coming here since my child is 2. And yeaterday my child got a rash all over her body so i went as a walked in and they Denied seeing her !! They said the Dr was booked (as i see the waiting area completely empty!!) and that they dont take walkins. So they asked an MA to step outside and take a look at her just to make sure its not like technically a life and death situation. AN MA!!! Is nottttt a DR!! How can they deny seing my 2 year old bcus im a walkin . How am i supposed to schedule ahead of time for such an unfortunate thing that no parent wants to see on our babies bodies. So i make an appointment for the next day because well , its not a life or death situation.... so i gave her Benadryl thay night and the next morning the rash had gone Way... so i call as early as they open... and the charge me $15 to cancel because cancelations need to be 25 hours in advance !! Sooo now they didnt wanna see her .... and now they charge me not to see her . All under 24 hours. Horrible!!! I needed a dr to tell me my baby was ok and it was an ok rash and they couldnt do that. They let me worry all night long  and now they charge me not to see her. I am never stepping foot in this clinic again. It only takes one time for someone to deny looking at your little girl . As parents we want their dr to care for them as much as we do because we are not doctors ... we dont know if anything or every little hing is ok.... we need them to tell us... but they too busy to... why couldnt the dr have stepped out for a secong just like the MA did.... but no... the receptionists didnt even try. NEVER AGAIN!!"
158,"The Service is Extremely Overpriced!
even in comparison with other Plastic
Surgeons on the same street. (Newbury).

Example:
Price of Juvederm outside with any other
Doctor 600 to 1000 for one syringe.
He gives you the price of 2,000, or
even more for one syringe, same
material Juvederm.
He doesn't have that much experience,
they don't even tell you his full profile
of the place that he graduated as an MD.

His approach during the questionary,
the way he makes the questions is not
very professional.
I think the 5 start reviews is from friends
employees or family.

Never Again!"
159,"TERRIBLE EXPERIENCE!

As a physician myself, I think I have reasonable expectations for other doctors and practices, and I understand how to navigate the medical system. However, this place makes it really difficult. I've been here twice now, and have had really bad experiences each time. 

My first time, I was there for over 2 hours for a medical visit, in which I spent 15 minutes with the doctor. I was just being transported from room to room waiting and waiting and waiting and waiting and waiting. I know these things happen, so I thought I'd give it another chance.

I had to return as one of my tests were sent improperly the first time. Not my fault. My second time there, I arrive, pay the 4 dollars CASH for parking, only to find out that they no longer take my insurance. My insurance hadn't changed and the appointment was booked months in advance. So they basically told me that I would have to be self pay, and it would be hundreds of dollars to have my testing resent. SERIOUSLY? 

It is common courtesy to call patients and notify them when policies change, especially if my insurance is already on file there. I'd recommend saving yourself the hassle and finding a different practice. It's unfortunate cause the docs are good, there's just a lot of other BS you have to deal with. NEVER AGAIN!"
160,"After dropping $3000 at the ER last year just to find out my 5 year old had heartburn and should take kids Tums, I vowed never again! And I haven't . 

This place is all you need. I will even go here over the pediatricians office if I think an X-ray is needed because they have it in-house. One less copay! Yea! 

The wait has never been long, the waiting room and examination rooms are always spic and span clean (cleaner than hospitals!) and the staff has always been courteous and competent. Need I say more? I hope you never have the need to go, but if you do..... don't hesitate!"
161,"Never again! After leaving this place I changed my PCP immediately. The facility is nice enough, and the girls that work the front were very helpful and nice. However, that's where the good experience ended. The wait time was ridiculous (it got up to one hour and I still had not been seen by the Dr.). The nurse that took me back after about 40 minutes of waiting was just downright rude and unprofessional with a bad attitude. So much in fact, that I refused to speak to her anymore until she got a different nurse. The replacement nurse (to their credit) was very kind and helpful but seemed disinterested in the previous happenings, and I got the impression she was just trying to get through the day. Tic toc tic toc, we are now up to one hour(and still was not yet seen by dr.) so I walked out of there. I needed blood work too so I can only imagine how long that would have taken. I don't have all day to be treated like crap on top of waiting forever. I DO have a job and things to do. My time is valuable too and there's no need to be an jerk-especially if you are in anything service oriented! And especially a NURSE! Combine the above things with no instructions over the phone on fasting etc even though I mentioned I wanted blood work several times and no appointment reminder (I had to call myself that morning to make sure they had me down). This place seems very disorganized and unprofessional. I expect FAR better care and customer service than this, from a dry cleaner much less the DOCTORS OFFICE. If you want to wait forever & then be treated like a number instead of a human, this is the perfect place. I however, will never be back."
162,Need to be zero stars. They don't answer their phones. Cancel due to equipment failure. Twice! Have been here over two hours for a MRI. Don't go here if you value your time! Never again!
163,"AVOID, AVOID, AVOID!!!!

My new insurance was going through application, so I had to pay cash when I went. So, they charge me to see the doctor, which was $130 approximately and then they tell me I am seeing a Physicians Assistant. Why are you billing me for a doctor's visit? There wasn't even a doctor there I come to find out. That's ridiculous.

So, I submit a claim to United Healtcare afterwards for reimbursement, but my claim gets denied. The letter says that info had been requested from Primary Care Center, but was ignored by them. All they asked for the diagnosis code, Physicians name, and their tax payer ID number. So, I had down there just to get these three things. So, I wait, and my letter goes to the back and then they come back with a printout of my diagnosis. So, I ask where is the tax-payer ID number? They responed, what is that? I finally had to wait on someone from the business office to come up and give it to me. What a bunch of f@cking idiots. Thank you for completely ignoring my insurance and making me do all of the work myself. 

NEVER AGAIN!"
164,"Don't pass judgement on people of color! A Dr. job is to help clients with pain relief as much as possible. Patients personal life is not for the Dr. to pass any kind of judgement! 
Some Dr. need to get themselves together & do their job! Don't look down your nose at your patients! We're real people with a lot of real pain going on & the last thing any patient needs is a condescending attitude! I would Never recommend this place to anyone! Ever! Never been treated with such disrespect! Never again! Dr. needs training on how to respect their new incoming patients! Btw Your staff is immensely impeccable! Unfortunately, the Dr. is Not! I think the Dr. should take more than a few tips from their staff!"
165,Had to go back 3 times because they couldn't get my glasses done properly. They were going to charge me an additional $60 to change my frames to the proper ones. The ones I asked for in the first place. I instead asked for a full refund. I had no confidence that they would get it right the fourth time. So they rather lose a $600 sale instead of waiving a charge of $60. Never again!  I'll go to the competition.
166,"Worst experience ever in my life with a specialist.  From some of the other bad reviews I've read it looks like we had the same experience.  The care I got from Dr. Fo put my life at risk by her not providing me the information and explaining all of my condition.  The cardiologist I see now is explains everything, is proactive, his office is nice and the service is excellent unlike what I experienced is Dr. Chalkias office.  Never again!"
167,"Regardless of you being a urgent care center. People come to you when they are in need. That means you are providing a service. Customer service is non existent here. The staff in the front is horrible. Seems like no one knows what's going on. Very Rude staff, slow, long wait time in waiting area. Longer wait in back waiting room! Worst part is we got done with the Dr. And still had to go wait in waiting room for 20min to check out! Never again!"
168,"Nah, more like a snake oil salesman.

I came in with high hopes based on other reviews. Fist off, he told me over the phone the visit would cost me '60 bucks', which magically transformed into $115 at check out. What the $*?&%##?? Explanation, 'ah, 60 bucks to check you and the extra is for the treatment'. That's not what he told me on the phone. Why would I have agreed to come in to hear what ailments I have (which I already know) and not get treated??? I explicitly asked because the insurance would not cover his treatment -- and now it was blatantly obvious why.

Anyhow, after hearing his long diatribe about how 'real medicine' is broken, blah, blah, and reading though the little card I filled out, he proceeded with the test and treatment. His excited words at the end: ""That's it, you're fixed!"". Wow -- I couldn't believe it. Really, I asked? Yeap.

After the overcharge/payment shock (fiasco, really), he shamelessly asked me to come in the next day for 'an adjustment' -- What the  $*?&%##?? Am I not already 'fixed'? Oh, yea but I want to do a follow up.... Which, of course, would NOT bee free of charge. I think Christmas was fast approaching and he probably needed a larger cash supply...

Needless to say, I had a huge flareup just as I was driving away. Thankfully it died out by next day. Never again!"
169,Beware if you don't have insurance or insurance only covers a limited number of visits. They'll charge you an outrageous amount for a 15 minute visit with an NP. They'll charge the patient 3-4 times what they would pay your insurance company. Never again!
170,"Two Words: Never Again! I experienced the slowest, most subpar service in the history of mankind topped off with excuses, attitude and a whopping $65 bill for a simple fill in with gel polish. Please save your money unless you're in the know about this salon because I was robbed and now have to go elsewhere and pay again to have it fixed."
171,"I made an appointment to go for a cleaning, when I got there they could not verify my insurance, the secretary Brianne kept asking me if I am sure that I have dental insurance! Really? How do you not know or sure that you have insurance?? Also, while I was sitting in the room, Brianne called me and left me a voicemail that I am late for my appointment and next time I should just reschedule!! Really??Anyways, after I got my cleaning on the next appointment, my tooth started hurting and they told me that I will need a root canal. Ok at this point I was like just pull it out, no they kept insisting that I should save the tooth, ok! I asked the secretary if she can tell me how much it would cost for a root canal, she quoted me $154, and explained that my insurance will cover 90% and I have to pay 10%.  Ok cool sounds good to me not expensive.  Made an appointment for a root canal, came in they started on my tooth, everything was fine.  I was done and ready to pay my copayment of $154, the office manager gives me a price of $435 or something close to that!! I'm not paying that because that is not what I was quoted, so the office manager said ""oh we didn't have an updated sheet of your coverage, but this is how much you owe now, wow!! I paid $154 and that was that, they are now billing me the rest of the amount, which I am not paying! This was at the end of last year 2011.  

So we are now in April 2012, I made an appointment to see another dentist.  he takes an xray of the tooth that had a root canal and tells me your tooth never had a root canal done.  At this point I didn't know what to say, so he shows me an xray of a tooth that had a root and my tooth, looks different. You can tell that nothing was done!!! 

I called Gentle Dental and explained to them what happened, so now I am waiting for a phone call from the dentist Dr.Rayev and the office manager Brenda.

Everyone told me not to go to Gentle Dental, but I did anyways.  Never again!!! Please listen when people tell you not go to Gentle Dental."
172,"This was my second time at a Joint location. I should have gone with my gut after reading the reviews, however my upper back desperately wanted relief. NEVER AGAIN! The chiropractor was very argumentative and downright rude when I told him that I was uncomfortable having my neck manually popped. The adjustment took about 1.5 minutes and I left hurting in places that I don't normally hurt. A day later I am still in so much pain and will have to go back for another adjustment but will find a different place. The original spot in my upper back still hurts but that pain is pales in comparison to all of the new pain from the adjustment. Despite the rude and argumentative chiropractor, my biggest problem with The Joint is the sales pitches. Although my adjustment took under 2 minutes, the sales pitch about packages and monthly memberships took 10+ minutes (both times I went to The Joint!) Listen up, the way you get repeat customers is by our experience!! Not by a sales pitch! If I have a good experience, and feel that my concerns are heard, I feel good after an adjustment, and the staff is friendly, I will be back! Don't waste your time and money!! The concept of lower cost chiro care and a walk in facility are great, however the reality is this place needs to rethink the customer experience!"
173,"Should you want your time wasted, receive poor customer service and pay exorbitant prices then this is the place for you! After making an appt., confirming the appt. and receiving an e-mail reminding me of the appt. time and the importance of being on time, I sat for nearly an hour to be seen. My time is just as valuable as theirs but that makes no difference to them.  I had a previous experience with this place once before and vowed never to go back but had no choice due to my insurance coverage and even advised them of this at the very beginning of the process but apparently they don't care. Well Never again! I am canceling my insurance and will save the money I spend on premiums to use for my glasses next time and purchase them from someone who cares about me rather than their greedy interests."
174,"Too bad there is no option for less than one star!

THE DOCTOR DIDNT EVEN LOOK AT MY SKIN! He walks in asks me why I'm there and has his assistant hand me some pamphlets on eczema, then began to leave... I was absolutely STUNNED.! He didn't even address the reason why i came in! Actually he hardly spoke to me, but not before asking to ""look at the back of my legs""!  Hello! the problem was with my hands you inappropriate rude pervert! I felt so angry and violated!

He took  just a few seconds to actually look at my skin! A dermatologist looking at skin.... Oh the thought!  I was so confused.   The ladies in the front were very sweet and welcoming. I had heard that they didnt have the best customer service BUT THE PROBLEM WAS THIS JERK DOCTOR! All he seemed to care about  is shuffling people through and making as much money as possible.Especially if you have insurance!! I was charged more than $275 on my insurance for less than five minutes of this quack's time! If you actually have a problem I suggest going somewhere else.Unless you plan on having an expensive procedure done. Then you have come to the right place and I'm sure you will get the royal treatment! NEVER NEVER AGAIN!!!!!!"
175,The doctors ordered tests that were unnecessary and did not tell me prior that it would cost me $400. Never again!
176,"If I had a choice, I would not even give them 1 star!!!  I had my wisdom teeth extracted here, I was put to sleep for the procedure.  I woke up, and let me tell you I can remember everything that happened from the time I woke up.  I got off the chair and asked what my co-pay for the extractions is.  The receptionist told me I do not have a co-pay.  I said ok Thank you and made sure I saw the dentist to tell him thank you before I walked out the door.  The following day I got a threatening phone call from the receptionist saying that I left without paying them my co-pay, they said they screamed for me to come back as I walked out of the office, False! That never happened.  I asked them to send me the bill for it and I would gladly pay for it.  The last thing I wanted was a negative mark on my credit report.  Months went by, I didn't receive a bill.  I would call to ask for it, they said they sent and would send another one.  The next thing I know, I get a bill from the collection agency for a larger amount than what I was told.  I called the office, of course they spoke to me in the rudiest way possible and said that those were late charges.  I was astonished!
And to add to this nightmare, I don't know how they extracted my wisdom teeth, but I had a large cut on both sides on my mouth, they must tried to open my mouth bigger than it could open.  I couldn't eat for a week and half.
After that visit is when several patience from my pharmacy told me, ""I could've told you not to go there.""  
Never again!  
PLEASE STAY AWAY FROM THIS PLACE!
Patients deserve honesty, it's our health!"
177,Made an appointment for 2:30pm and registered online. Got to my appointment 10 min early. Checked in and paid. Said that I'd be next. Still waiting at 3:05!!! I left work for this? If I wasn't so sick and or my doctor had an available appointment I would never have come here. Never again!
178,"I have had a few ""basic"" teeth cleaning at this location. On my first visit, I wasn't very pleased with the whole experience. But, I decided to give them a second chance. I had another visit a few weeks ago. I can't recall the name of the doctor, but certainty was a much better experience, WAY better than the first time! 

Last time, while there, I totally missed asking my Dr. for a prescription for a medication (cold sore). I'm having a really bad burning on my lip for the last few hours so, I stopped by today, 3/29/2018 and I asked the front desk person if it was possible to get a prescription, since I was just there recently. I was told that I needed to pay for the visit. $95!? Are you serious!? I said no, thanks and left.

To all who are reading this honest review, BE CAREFUL, do yourself a favor and have your teeth clean someplace else. I will never put a foot here in the future, never again! 

Good thing that as I steeped out, I went back and asked for a copy of my last full mouth x-rays I had done a little bit ago. They just lost me!

No wonder why this place have terrible reviews."
179,Waited 2.5 hours and STILL haven't been seen! Then they said it'll be ANOTHER hour before I get seen!!!!! Never again! NO ONE communicated ANYTHING to me! I will NEVER come here again!
180,"Listen and listen good. Whatever y'all do, please don't EVER go to the Great Expressions Dental Center on Cascade. I don't care if all of your teeth are hanging on by lil pieces of gum, DON'T GO! I've never had a good experience there but tried to continue going to support US. NEVER AGAIN!"
181,"Never again! Very unprofessional. The only way to speak with anyone over the phone is if you leave a voice mail and wait. And they warn you if you call more than once, your return call will be ""delayed."" Had a horrible time trying to submit a prescription, and once they did, they sent it with the wrong name. What kind of medical office is this?!?!! Medication is time-sensitive!! I was supposed to begin my prescription 9 days ago and they have yet to send the correct prescription to my pharmacy. I'm looking into malpractice. I would never recommend this place to anyone. I am so disappointed that I can be treated this way! I have insurance and paid my copay and everything."
182,Was there for 15 minutes...Receptionist not friendly...It was close to closing and they wanted to rush us out of there and send us to ER..They quickly looked at my child and said take him to ER even though it was just a flu..We were there for 15 minutes and got $400 bill..Never again!
183,"I seriously love Zoomcare. They take something that inherently is pretty shitty and make it as pleasant as possible. 

Before I started using Zoomcare, I went to a large teaching hospital for all my medical appointments, where I often had to wait to be seen for more than an hour beyond my scheduled appointment time and waiting in line to check in was on par with the dmv.  

Never again! At Zoomcare, your appointment time actually means something and the doctors are ready when they're supposed to be. Booking is straightforward. The receptionist is friendly. The doctors are competent and kind. All wins in my book.  

The only thing I wish they would improve is their website's compatibility with mobile browsers -- either that or make a booking app."
184,"DO NOT DO LASER HAIR WITH THIS PEOPLE!

This place is a scam! All they want is your money. They always cancel my appointments at the last minute. The receptionists that talk to you over the phone are rude and can't speak clear English. There are other places out there better than this people. Do not waste your money and time with them.

* I've had 4 sessions (underarm) and my hair is still there. I still have to shave everyday...

Update: What was bad, became worse. After 3 months trying to go there and having several appointments cancelled, they finally scheduled me. I went there and my laser session (underarms) hurt more than the previous times. Also, I felt a burning sensation on my way back home. When I arrived home, I saw that my armpits were literally burned! I had little red dots all over it (had never felt that in any of the sessions done before). I could not wear deodorant for several days. A week has passed and now the red dots became gray. I wonder if the skin will fall of...

That's what happens when you buy groupon deals... never again!"
185,"I would rather pull my teeth out then EVER come here again. Unhelpful staff, long wait time, and uninformative.  Never again!"
186,"Contemplated about writing a review for this establishment. Just glimpsing at the reviews validates my experience was correct.

FYI~ I'm a domesticated cat in the area of  spa/therapy/massage/asian remedies etc...
Got a last minute appointment on a Tuesday for a massage (mainly for my knee). Lady on the phone was pleasant and I confirmed my appointment for 20 mins acupuncture and 40 mins massage.  
I arrived early and was surprised how different this location is compared to the Unihealth on South Granville I've visited 2 years back.
I've reconfirmed my treatment plan with the receptionist and proceeded to one of the rooms. Typical gown and thin sheets. No complaints no praises.
Acupuncturist comes in and inquires topic of treatment and proceeds. I've received 2 needles and leaves me in a thin sheet for 30 mins. 
Returns on the 31st min and delicately move the skin on my neck and shoulder one cold hand at a time from beginning to ending for the remainder of the time. Her hand still cold at the end.

Technique~ Fail
Effort ~Fail
Attitude~Fail

I've left in worst condition before even going in for the treatment.
What is this? $25 dollar a needle?!
I sat back in my car with the heat and seat warmer on. Confused, mentally and physically tired calling my MT for emergency treatment on this treatment.

Never again!"
187,"I have the most complicated mouth. 
I constantly have something going on with my mouth, due to TMJ work done, almost 40 years ago! I went to different people back then, but never again!
The only people I trust are Dr Vanstrom and his staff! It is perfectly clear that the patient comes first! He is great about listening and so is his staff! 
You can feel the welcome when you walk in the door! 
Trust me!!!! Don't go anywhere else!!  EVER!!!"
188,"Never again! Straight to the point. The Station Seat where I was told to sit was unbelievably incredibly filthy, and I mean FILTHY! Black marks, black stains, with some sort of really gross looking gooey orange sludge stains all around the very edge of the base. It all looked as if it had been gone over with a heavily soiled dirty mop. Imagine spreading those nasty bacterial germs from room to room to incubate for the next day's patients. I know, hard to believe, but in all my 62 years I've never seen any Dental operating room even remotely close to how disgusting this was.

OH! but it got worse! After noticing all that, and even said something about it, the assistant started mounting the 3 instrument drill tools soon to be used in my mouth with her bare hands after just watching her typing on the computer for the last 5 mins, and touching everything else she came in contact with. Like I said, NEVER AGAIN! So as a warning, and you value your health, ENTER AT YOUR OWN RISK!"
189,"I saw Dr. Moses Gallegos and I am actually amazed he is allowed to see patients.  He was condescending and mean.  And he did not care that I was on the verge of tears with everything he was saying to me.  
And the worst part is that he would not even exam me even though I told him I was in pain!  He totally acted like I was wasting his time.  I saw him earlier in the year and he acted the same way, but I know everyone has a bad day so I gave it a second chance.  But never again!  I will change practices if I have to."
190,"Sadly after getting lip augmentation I was shocked on the price increase since I travel and used to love to come and have several things done ; this was the second time I questioned a price increase . But not only have they changed quite a bit they cant seem to keep staff. High turn over rate here. People that used to work here try to encourage me to go elsewhere but i remained loyal. But what happened to me was inexcusable not only did  the front desk new receptionist ignore me when l questioned the high bill for the same filler that was used the last time, but she was rude and was strangely avoiding me. After the fact she gets the office manager wife of Dr. Hall, who continues to berate me over the fact I got discounts but failing to tell me before hand there was a price increase. It was like SURPRISE --  the second time this happened here. Embarrassing was the word! And her indiscretion and telling me off in front of several people was to shut me up and her cruel smile made obvious that she felt she won the augument. How could anyone come to place that would purposely embarrass their clientele and expect them to return blaming you, not them. Sadly a woman who happened to be a witness at Halls ran into me at the grocery store  came up to me and told me I was in the right by her failure to inform me of the price increase. So For this reason be warned before any procedures -- ask for the price in writing. This is not Bevery Hills where they bill you without giving you a price  -- been there done that. Never again!  Plain greed, UPDATE .................After this review was posted TIsha Hall called my private residence SEVERAL times  and confronted me at HEB when I went grocery shopping yesterday upset about the review I wrote; her harassment is getting  concerning I  am planning to report her to the BBB and law enforcement if she continues to stalk and berate me. She has real anger issues. Still shocked by the behavior. I say never again."
191,"About 2 years ago I went to see Dr. Eaccarino (everyone calls him Dr. E) he is probably the worst doctor I have ever been too. No joke. I told him I was doing natural family planning (it worked for me and my husband for 10 years) and he had a smug attitude and told me well there must be something wrong with you bc it doesn't work. His mannerisms, his cocky-matter of fact attitude, and his lecturing me on my medication choices were ridiculous. He is very arrogant. I have doctors I absolutely love that have never acted the way he did! It's been 2 years since I've gone to an obgyn bc of the stuff he said to me. If I could give him no stars I would. Maybe work on some bedside manners Dr. E? Maybe treat your patients better? Maybe cut out the snarky comments? Never again!"
192,"Second time here in a week and the wait is longer than 3 1/2 hours as they say you will have to wait! The customer service is horrible. I ask how long is the wait for the 5th time and I get the same answer ""we have emergencies"". Ok I get that but we have been here well over 4 hours already! Ugh never again!"
193,"Wow, total incompetence. I took my son there Monday night (he was sick with fever Friday, Sat and Sunday so 2 school days missed). He had a horrible sour throat, fever, lethargic and miserable. And he had bumps on his face. Rather than the doctor actually doing her job and testing for flu and strep she diagnosed him with Hand Foot Mouth disease even though he is 8 and that is a toddler virus. No medicine, no antibiotics. We went home and he continued to get worse. Took him to s real doctor Friday morning (day 8). Raging ear infection and Strep. That doctor could have done the strep test and given him antibiotics on MONDAY. So he misses 6 days of school and is pain because of incompetence. Never again!!"
194,"This was not my first stay at the Peach, but it will absolutely be my last. The climate is kept so cold you need to wear sweats practically 24/7. I needed 4 blankets at night. One hand doesn't know what the other is doing, as some clerk was very insistent that they changed their rules and now only allowed seeing eye dogs. I politely explained to her the difference between an emotional support dog and a Registered Service Dog. But this lady would not take no for an answer, even tho it had already been cleared with PTH. She rudely asked me if I had any paperwork on her, which, by the way I am not legally required to carry, but I did  have her collar clip, the back of which has the ADA OF 1990 guidelines on the back. I watched her read it, say they that's nice but they only allow seeing eye dogs and grabbed my meds bag. I told her unless that dog was going back with me, she better drop those meds. It went downhill from there. NEVER AGAIN!!! Must say, props to nurses and mht's. Only people that made it bearable!"
195,"Worst experience ever at the dentist.  My whole reason for going was a cleaning, yet nobody in the office seemed aware of that fact.  I had to remind every single person.  Come to find out their calendar had me scheduled for a cleaning.  Why would the hygienist, dentist, assistant, and receptionist not know that.  After waiting for over 45 mins, I finally got taken back for x-ray only to discover the equipment didn't work.  When it came time for the actual cleaning, I had to wait another 30 mins.  Every member of the staff I encountered dropped the ball.  When  I informed the office manager of this, she called the two front office workers over and asked me to tell them what the issues were; awkward and unprofessional.  The office manager kept saying to let her know if there was nothing she could do to make it up to me.  I said she could wave the $60 fee they were charging, to which she replied they couldn't do, then offered me a free tooth brush and mouthwash.  NEVER AGAIN!"
196,"Never again! Go here if you have nothing to do but sit here and wait all day! I'm not exaggerating either. Upon arrival I was informed there was a two hour wait.. I proceeded to fill out the forms and waited. 2 hours turns into 3, then upon calling your name they sit you in a room where the nurse checks your vitals etc. Places you in another room and says ""you're next to be seen by the Dr"". Well, 15 min later nothing, 30 min later nothing, an hour more later and no sign of the Dr. I literally had to lose it to get serviced. After alll this is an urgent care!?!! Well, definitely no sense of urgency and the Dr although a pretty ""nice person"" doesn't seem to realize the importance and value of patient experience. So in a nutshell, after 5 1/2 hours I guess I can say I was seen and diagnosed by the physician. Good thing I went to urgent care.... 

Save your money and time and go elsewhere."
197,"First let me say I have been to this location in the past to meet with Dr. Anthony Mills who is Amazing at what he does, I've been treated by Dr. Mills for over a year now with HUGE success and I HIGHLY recommend him! HOWEVER, I do not recommend you visit this location unless you verify he is in. BE WARNED do NOT waste your time to go in and meet with the woman with the heavy Russian accent who claims to be a ""Nurse Practitioner"" She is RUDE beyond explanation, She walks around as if she is Miss Russia! I will never step foot inside this location again! This is the second time I have come to the Concourse location only to be met by RUDE, Obnoxious unfriendly staff MORE SO the ""Nurse Practitioner"" whatever her name is the Russian with short red hair and the ATTITUDE the size of TEXAS! Who do you think you are speaking to people the way you do? I just got up and walked out. Both my husband and I had appointments to meet with Dr. Mills, who I was told had a personal emergency and would not be able to see us, but the ""Nurse Practitioner"" would be assisting us. Well lets just say I can almost understand why she's got a black eye! Somebody didn't take your rudeness so lightly? It's a sad shame people like her can affect a business owner and their business with such bad ratings! I will follow Dr. Mills to any other location, but this one NEVER AGAIN! Good luck keeping your business going.. I would almost bet she's not a real ""nurse practitioner, or at least not here in the US!"
198,"I saw a doctor and Diagnosed with upper respiratory infection for 7 days. Tells me to go buy Afrin and spray up my nose. Took my insurance and $80 co-pay. Follow up with primary if not better in 2-3 day. Called back 4 days later still sick . Makes it 11 days sick. Asking them to call in an Antibiotic. They said I would have to come in again and pay the same amount for another doctor to see me??? For what to tell me I need two aspirin!! I need an antibiotic!! God I'm not a magician or a Doctor but God an Infection usually calls for an Antibiotic!  Never Again! By the way I waited 7 days to go because I didn't have the co-pay. I don't have it for a second time. Sitting at home still sick. I asked the assistant to call the doctor that saw me Dr. Wiboon to call in a prescription and she said ""He's going to need to see you again."" I again stated I didn't have the money to cover the co pay and she said. ""Yea, I'm sorry about that"" and hung up."
199,NEVER AGAIN!!!!!!! Terrible customer service. They are very rude and act like they cannot be bothered!! Stay away from this place. My glasses  were suppose to get delivered to my house and they got lost in the mail. THEN when I call them theyy give me an attitude about it! I'm done with going to LensCrafters!
200,Still sitting here after checking in online at 800 this morning for a 1230 pm slot.  So far I waited outside for an hour and now in a room for half an hour and only my vitals were done.  I have an injured wrist and feel the er may have taken me in sooner than this.  Never again!!
201,"If you're looking for a dentist for your child this is NOT the place. No child experience. I was told to find a pediatric dentist. Unhappy with the visit. The two girls upfront were nice though! I didn't even know I had saw the dr because she didn't introduce herself. Didn't tell me if my daughter had any cavities, I had to ask one of the girls upfront. First and last time here for us. Plus we waited a hr to get a cleaning. Never again!"
202,"Great staff, out of control rude alpha female doctor.  It's her way or the highway, and she makes that very clear.  If you like being demeaned, mocked and generally pushed around, this is the doctor for you!  Never, never again!!"
203,"I wish I had read the reviews before going to Great Expressions Midtown.   I am new to Atlanta and this office is located within walking distance of home and covered by my insurance, so I gave it a go.  My dental visits are routine and nothing has changed since my last visit, yet the dentist insisted on trying to sell me braces (something I do not need) and the most expensive cleaning (something else I do not need)... then refused to do a basic cleaning when I declined the up-charges and ""treatment plans"".  The equipment was old and falling apart.  The mouth guards were so dilapidated that they hurt my mouth and I couldn't keep them in long enough for proper x-rays. Never again!"
204,"Just plain slow, rude, and awful service. Well other than the guy at the front desk. He's about the best person they have there working. On August 29 around 5pm, when I arrived it was only me and one other person there. The other person was in and out in a matter of minutes. However then it took almost an hour to me. By then several other people came in. Then they called a person that had come in about 30 minutes behind me to the back and then me. The girl then proceeded to help the other person that came behind me by doing their weight and putting them into a room. She then just placed me in a room without weighing me or anything. I asked why was the long delay and she said they were eating. After then I was placed in the room. Then about 15 min later another girl came and asked general questions. However after she left I waited, and waited, and after what seemed like forever. So I went asked will the doctor be seeing me anytime soon and I was informed that he would be seeing the person that came behind me first. I was like unbelievable. It would've been faster for me to just go to the ER or Centra Care. Never again! A complete waist of time, effort, and energy. I had to end up leaving there and ultimately going to the ER. Just awful. No type of regard or respect for anyone's time. No type of communication, just nothing . I can understand if they were busy, however that wasn't the case, it was poor service."
205,"This has to BE tHe woRst hospital experience ever! My wife is 32 weeks pregnant came in because she has thee flu and can not breathe properly and she has very bad chest pain.  They take her back wait  20mins before they take vitals. Take another 30 mins before they do blood work and then put us back into the waitting room. Not once did they check her lungs, her throat  or why she is in pain and not even once did they check to see if our child is still okay. Not only that but the waiting room they  have a nurse come out and take out someone's  I.v line out who ichni thought was  gross and very insanitary. Horrible experience here! I will never cOme back here again and I hope Anyone who reads this understands  how disappointed my wife and myself were when coming to this hospital. Never again! Worst hospital in Columbus!"
206,"This was not my first stay at the Peach, but it will absolutely be my last. The climate is kept so cold you need to wear sweats practically 24/7. I needed 4 blankets at night. One hand doesn't know what the other is doing, as some clerk was very insistent that they changed their rules and now only allowed seeing eye dogs. I politely explained to her the difference between an emotional support dog and a Registered Service Dog., even tho the dog had already been cleared with PTH. She rudely asked me if I had any paperwork on her, which, by the way I am not legally required to carry, but I did  have her collar clip, the back of which has the ADA OF 1990 guidelines on the back. I watched her read it, say they that's nice but they only allow seeing eye dogs and grabbed my meds bag. I told her unless that dog was going back with me, she better drop those meds. It went downhill from there. NEVER AGAIN!!! Must say, props to nurses and mht's, the ONLY people that made it bearable!  They do a hell of a job with what they've got to work with. They earned my 1 star. The other 4- good luck."
207,"Terrible office. I get blood work done. Doctor Zelner gives me the findings but she does not give me prescriptions nor solutions. She just tells me to buy her book. After over charging me and getting a terrible check up, I got basically nothing! NEVER again!"
208,"Definitely the dirtiest looking hospital that I've been to in Austin. We arrived at 1:00 pm, and there was no one at the information desk. We followed the signs to outpatient services, but only found empty desks. Still no one at the information desk, but a nurse by the elevators told us outpatient services had recently moved to the 2nd floor. Wonder when they'll be changing the signs, or hiring enough people to have desk coverage. Then outpatient services said they hadn't received the orders from the doctor, which is unlikely since we saw the nurse fax them. Nobody seemed terribly competent or interested in customer service. It was my mom who needed to go here, but NEVER AGAIN!"
209,Terrible!!! Avoid this place at all costs!!! Went in to see an ophthalmologist for an eye issue I had just so they would tell me I had a form of conjunctivitis and that it would just go away on its own and didn't prescribe me anything! Then they had the nerve to send me a bill for 150 dollars for literally NOTHING!!!! Never again!
210,"Interesting observation that the only comments here are from awhile ago and the most recent one is from the administrator of the place. This may have once been a fine place but no longer. My mother consistently received sub-par care, benign neglect at best. There are a few good staff members in the nurses and physical therapy staff, but the rest have some very poor unhappy attitudes that are reflected in their patient care (or lack of). I could write pages and pages about how my mother managed to  ""somehow"" fall and break her hip on visit one, and on visit two (never again!) was literally screaming in pain from a perforated ulcer on her stomach wall (likely caused from too much aspirin being administered) for several hours during which time a staff member told her to shut up or she would give her something to scream about. Horrible place. I honestly can't say anything nice or positive about the place. Depressing atmosphere, subpar staff, and poor care. Avoid!"
211,"Never again!!!! Never, first Florida Blue says ins accepted however was charged not the $35 copay but $189 wth I'm too sick to care.  

No don't have Coronavirus symptoms therefore I guess I'm a nobody!! Had a 3 pm appt waited in lobby til 350 pm have had vitals taken and have been setting back here since then which makes my wait time 1 hr 45 min with an appt.    NEVER AGAIN. However would love to see Dr Deborah go into private practice she is awesome....."
212,"Absolutely the worst business to ever deal with. You will spend days/weeks trying to get anyone on the line from billing, but if you want to become a new patient they will answer within 2 rings. Staff is rude and condensing so if it were possible to give zero stars I would have. Never again!"
213,The wait is terrible . Not sure why the feel like it's okay to have anyone sitting in a waiting room for over an hour. There are way too many eye doctors in the city to put up with this . Never again!!
214,"Please do yourself a favor and stay FAR FAR AWAY from Ideal Image. Not only will they not return your 3 phone calls and fail to keep appts, the office manager, Denise McIntyre, might think it's more important to meet the locksmith at her apt than you. Icing on the cake is their estimate of $8586 for 9 treatments of legs-only laser hair removal (kindly financed by their bank at 22.4%t). Long backstory short, my husband purchased a $325 gift certificate (recco by 96.7 Bobby Bone's show), which turned out to be only ONE THIRD the price of the FIRST treatment. After said rigmarole we were told the g.c. was absolutely non-refundable ""as stated on the back"". It finally took 2 weeks of escalation to the VP to get our money back. I've since found a great deal on Group-on for, $99/3 treatments (only 6 suggested). Ok, my bad for not trusting yelp in the first place...never again!"
215,"Had Coolsculpting done, left me permanently bruised. Staff/doctor did not care. Gave me some bullshit cream to pacify me. Told me it would fade. Never did. NEVER AGAIN!!!"
216,"Never, never, never again!! From my first communication to set up an appointment with the most unprofessional scheduler, to our first visit where the desk people were terrible (even answering the phone with the WRONG business name while we were in the waiting room), to now, almost a year later and they are STILL sending their bill to the incorrect address (repeatedly).

On top of that the orthotics were awful and ridiculously expensive. After my daughter walked around for a couple months complaining about how much the orthotics squeaked I took her to Road Runner Sports and in 15 minutes they molded some new orthotics for 1/5 of the price that are perfect."
217,"If you are planning on getting your wisdom teeth removed, please do not come to this location. 

1. I called this office and the scheduled an appointment for my wisdom teeth removal. However, they were not clear about whether or not I was going to be doing the surgery that day or just a consultation, so either way, I took days off from work to be able to heal properly. They never gave me any pre surgery care or what to expect information. 

2. When I get there, they are still not clear about whether I'm getting the surgery done on the same day. I had to ask multiple times and they just said ""yea if you want today we can do it today"" very nonchalantly as if this was a simple procedure. 

3. The dentist does my consultation and they proceed to tell me I have to pay 3,800 for the procedure. I have insurance, so this seemed weird to me. I call my insurance and they were clear that they covered most of the cost. The office then said they managed to decreased the price to 1,700 through a smile care insurance. I explained that my insurance covered it, but the late in charge of insurance said that I could pay now and get refunded later after talking to my insurance. 

I was in pain and desperate to get my wisdom teeth out and I had also requested time off already, so I trusted them and completed the transaction. 

4. Although they had anesthesia to numb my mouth, they do not have anesthesia so I wouldn't be awake or hear what was going on. I was awake through the whole process and it was extremely traumatizing. This is something I wish they would've told me prior to the surgery. They offered me pills to put me to sleep, but I don't usually like taking pills. 

5. After the surgery, they did not give me any literature on what to do and what not do. Everything I knew about after care I had to search online. All they told me was what not to eat and to change my bandages. While I overheard the dentist tell another patient to use salt water to disinfect the area, I never got that information. 

6. The insurance lady is incredibly difficult to work with. When I contacted my insurance, they called her and she was super difficult with them. She told me that she knew that telling me I would get a refund would haunt her. I had to file a complaint with my insurance, and that was the only way in which I was able to get my money back. This happened 7 months after my surgery. 

7. My insurance told me my whole procedure only cost 750 dollars, which is what I was expecting. They were ready to charge me triple that! They also added things that I did not need whatsoever. 

Please save your money and do not visit any coast dental locations. They try to add as much as they can to make the most of you. I felt like a consumer instead of a patient throughout this whole experience. Never again!"
218,"First visit - never again! I set up an appointment for my 15 year old - she had a horrible sore throat and fever so we wanted her checked for strep. When we got there the staff discovered AFTER we had checked in and filled out all their paperwork, that my daughter's appointment was erroneously set up for 2 days later!  No one waits 2 days for a strep test and they knew it, but instead of apologizing for their obvious error and trying to work her in (she's sitting there flushed and feverish and sick), they tell me that they can squeeze her in 5 hours later if I'd like to bring her back!

Unbelievably bad customer service"
219,"Do NOT go to this place. Rude staff, specially a woman call Candice, she told a patience to leave because he was watching a movie on his phone. Place is ghetto! Never again!"
220,"Yes, it's easy to make an appointment but that's about all. I had to go directly from a Zoom Care to a real doctor. I rolled my ankle and it turns out that I not only broke it, but tore a ligament as well. The Doctor didn't even touch my ankle and didn't even take my vital signs. I've never experienced that, even my Dentist takes vitals. They tried to sell me a walker boot to stabilize my ankle, then charge me over $200 for it. They claimed my insurance wouldn't pay for it, but when I called my insurance they said it's a covered expense. I found the same walker boot on Amazon for $30 shipped. Zoom care is to humans what Banfield is to pets. Never again!
UPDATE-I received a bill showing my insurance paying only $20 for my xrays. I conference called my insurance company and Zoom Care and my insurance covers 100% of the charges. I have Blue Cross and Blue Shield, so either they're completely inept when dealing with the most common insurance plan or they're scamming their customers. Either way it's equally as embarrassing for them."
221,"Don't ever fucking come here. Especially if you are uninsured. They will rape you for every little penny you have. 

I went there to get immunized for school. $800!!!!!!!!!!!!!

EIGHT-HUNDRED-DOLLARS!!!!!! 

Grated, i was uninsured but 8-0-0 DOLLARS!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!

ASSHOLES!!!!!!!!

NEVER AGAIN! EVEN IF I'M DYING!!!

If I ever get hit by a bus, and it happens right in front of Brighton Marine, TAKE ME TO MGH INSTEAD. I don't even care that it's all the way across town."
222,"I really enjoy shopping at this mall. It is always really clean and it seems like there is always a new store that I hadn't noticed before. 

**However I will never shop at the LOFT store at this mall again. The employees are very rude and snobby. Perhaps it's because I'm not the usual customer i.e. a middle aged woman with a mom haircut wearing penny loafers with a snobby disposition? Every time I have been they are over staffed but no one is available to assist in the fitting room. I really dislike having to get re-dressed to go back out on the floor to get another size. When I check out they always seem disgusted that I only buy only 1 or 2 items.  But I keep trying only to be reminded that I really dislike that location. Noted! Never again! End rant**

Excluding that disgrace of poor customer service, this mall is just dandy and fulfills most of my shopping wants."
223,"never again! so they only staff one doctor here on fridays. :( which means that I waited 4 hours before seeing the physician. The fact they would even be OPEN with only one doctor to a dozen + patients is disappointing. Why even keep the lights on! Why have a dozen exam rooms and ONE physician. The physicina himself was kind and knowledgeable once I finally saw him. But some simple x-rays for a fractured wrist that should have only taken 10 minutes to an hour cost me much more time an dmoney. THEN, the attending nurse or CNA, appleid gauze directly to my open wound on my knee, after specifically telling her not to do that. I told her I could do it myself but she assured me she would do it right. I spent the next subsequent hours in far more pain than the broken wrist itself peeling off the gauze."
224,I've never been talk to so bad by a dr in my life. Dr b made me feel like the fact my son had an allergic reaction to something I was a nasty blk woman with doogy poop and roaches  (in dr b voice) being that I took my son to the er for swollen eyes  and bumps all over his legs.  Dr b felt he needed to tell me YOU PEOPLE TAKE YOUR KIDS TO THE ER FOR ANYTHING. AND THAT'S NOT WHAT AN ER IS FOR. I asked what do you mean you ppl he just laughed and told me if you don't like what I'm saying then go find another doctor. No matter how many times I told him dr b you will not sit here and talk to me like I'm ignorant and dumb he kept on putting my down until finally I told my son put on your shoes and let's go. Mean while dr b is just standing there laughing. And the front staff is no better they were just sitting with there heads down laughing. Makes you feel like as a parent you're doing something wrong. NEVER AGAIN!!!
225,"Took my son there for his first 2 years and never again. Dr Franz is always busy, never have any opening when is time for his check up and Angela was amazing but for the last 4 appointments she is never available, another Dr Craven was sweet but too young for me to trust her.
The last 4 times we waited 2 HOURS to be seen and they call you, we undress our kid, and after their weight we have to return to the front office, which the last time was too crowded so they put us in the back, break room for 45 minutes and forgot about ut there!!! Then they called us to get the shots in the open room in the middle of the hallway, the nurses were so rude, and put the bandaid so tight that when we got home my child had a lump and it was all red and swollen, something that didn't happen for 2 years. NEVER AGAIN!!!!"
226,"Scammed me of my money. Today I went to see Dr. Lai, to see if he can get me new dentures. He did a series of imaging, just to tell me that he couldn't do anything about my implants. The tech literally jammed the mouth piece into my gums, and didn't seem to care even after I told her I was pain. Was told that it would cost me $3,500 to replace everything and got charged almost $300 just for him to tell me that there was nothing he could do. I was in and out in a total of 30 minutes. Sorry, but never again!"
227,"Im a PRO when it comes to teeth..dentistry.

I went here because i carry dental insurance through my job..

So since this is close to where i reside i decided since they are open Saturdays - hey give them a shot..

OMG - No patient bibs on dental exams.. rookie dental assts with lack of professionalism.. Answering your cellphone while working and dealing with a patient..?!

Even the Dr's are lacking of knowledge and professionalism! _ HEAVY sales IE; The Ortho Dr.. he was giving me deals like he was about to sell me a car!! 

In one day in less than 2 hours I had Xrays..Exam..Ortho consult and a 10 MIN cleaning without using dental scaling instruments -- just a prophy jet! .. WTH..

I had to ask the dental hygienist to replace the chair cover because it looked greasy and hasnt been changed from previous patients!!

NEVER again!"
228,"Scammers! Went to Dr. Dunson about 4 years ago for routine checkup. He said he needed to take out my silver filling and replace it with composite. (They use composite bc it costs more) Getting 3 root canal this month bc of it. 

I had HORRIBLE sensitivity and pain afterwards and went back in for checkup. He was surprised at how much pain I was in and told me it just needed to heal. No apology, pain medication, nothing. Well here I am FOUR years later with the same pain and now having to get a root canal on the teeth he filled. The experience and pain were so terrible, this year was my 1st time back to a dentist, bc now the pain is unbearable. Current dentist tells me I need 3 root canals and had a chipped composite.  Never again!"
229,"No parking.  Small and very loud waiting room.  Front desk is rude and doesn't share updates of doctors running late.  We waited 2 hours and the attitude was one of ""this is typical, deal with it"".  

Never saw this in a well-run ambulatory center, but when patients are through with there procedure, they come back out through the waiting room to exit.  Impersonal, odd seeing sedated patients and having them complain as they walk by.  Further, a series of men walking through the waiting area with beaten-up dirty coolers to collect tissue samples to take to pathology...tacky, disgusting and so incredibly unprofessional. 

NEVER AGAIN!  Avoid it."
230,"i'm giving it 1 star & they need a red flag as 0 star! this dentist office is very dishonest, they gave me one price and billed my insurance company extra. i strongly advised that before you have any work done, get the exact bill, verify what is covered, and what is your percentage, they changed the price on me - and also charge care credit extra!!!! buyer's beware!!!! the customer service from david when i inquired about my charged ( flaming hot attitude). how in the heck you don't know what i'm being charged for????? the bill is in front of you!!!! nasty attitude on top of ripping people off --- never again! equipment is outdated, building itself need to be upgraded! dr. johnson and dr. padolsky should be ashamed of themselves."
231,"NEVER again!!! Do not go here. I have taken my son here since he was an infant. We went in yest 4 a ear inf, which my son has long history of having them as and that's how we discovered his allergy 2 penicillin. They didn't have his correct allergy info in his chart nor did they know anything else!! They asked me his medical history when they did an MRI on him at 1 yes old!!!!! If I wanted a quick care I would go 2 1. Looking for a doctors office that really cares 4 their kids!!!"
232,"Short staffed, cranky, and lacking customer service skills,  this is the best of Quest Diagnostic.
The worst was waiting 4 months for results of my blood work despite multiple attempts from my doctor. When I went in person to pick up the test results I was met with a surly and defensive attitude and told that they had no way to access results. 
Finally I was able to get what I needed by calling customer service at the toll free #.
Never again!"
233,Doctor on 4th floor was great. Sent me to the 3rd floor (eye center) just to take a pic of my eye. The wait was past ridiculous! And the staff could care less. Too busy laughing and talking. NEVER again! A few patients waited so long they had to rescheduled. I see all the reviews say basically the same thing but apparently the eye center doesn't care about improving their service.
234,These people are idiots...PLAIN AND SIMPLE!  The dentist proposed pulling perfectly good teeth just to get a partial which I didn't want nor did I go there for.  I was only missing one tooth.  I told them I would come back with my insurance card for extractions because I was receiving it in the mail. I tried calling back like 45 times after that to schedule and they would not return my call. I even had a relative go in the office to schedule and they claimed they were having registration issues and NEVER called me back which was hilarious since there are so many dental office in the area.  I finally went to another affordable denture office and their services sucked too.  I finally realized that it's all affordable dentures in the Atlanta area because I had been to one in Florida and it was a completely different environment with professional people.  Will stick with out of state Affordable Dentures offices in the future. NEVER AGAIN!
235,This was absolutely the worst experience that I have had at a doctor's office. The front desk staff and receptionist behind the front desk staff were very rude. They gave me paperwork that took almost an hour to complete and after 3 hours informed me that they didn't know how much longer it would take since they had to enter the paperwork? Really? How long could it take to enter in paperwork. Patients came in and out before we were seen because she said that it was different for those that were involved in automobile accidents. I left there and took my children to their pediatrician. Never again!
236,"Worst ER experience ever. I will NEVER come here again. My 15 year old daughter was in excruciating abdominal pain. She couldn't walk. She could barely communicate! I told the front desk representative that she couldn't wait over an hour to be seen, my daughter wasn't going to make it for that long. No one even bothered to assess my daughter! I left the ER and tried to make it to Seton when my daughter fainted during the car ride there. I had to call EMS on the side of the road! They transferred her to Seton and are taking great care of her! It is absolutely ridiculous that no one bothered to even assess my daughter in this ER. Never again! I would stay as far away from this ER as you can!"
237,"Our recent visit to here left little to be desired! Though the ER was top notch and day one was flawless her condition quickly changed. They withheld her necessary medications, gave her the wrong insulin and allowed her to revert back to the state I brought her in! When I walked in her room to pick her up her blankets were stripped off (gets chilled easily) and tossed in a chair. She had not received any medication that day and they released her? I was going to take her to another hospital but decided I could give her the care she needed at home even better! This had been her hospital of choice but never again!"
238,"I should add that after the initial review, I did go back to this medical center (I figured let me give them a second chance) and actually got to see the doc that time. She seemed nice enough and things seemed to be better overall. There were some new exam tables and looked as though the place had been cleaned, so I actually had some hope. Had been in there a couple more times too. Fast forward to today. I had decided to take my son to her, so she could be his doc too (We did have an appointment). Now this was a big step for me! We got there and did the paperwork, thought we were set to go. WRONG! For some reason the receptionist was having issues with understanding my insurance and if I had a co-pay or not (I get that, it can be very hard to decipher), so I explained that I didn't have a co-pay because of the kind of plan it is, and also that I had been going there for more than a year. So I asked her if maybe she could check out my record, since it was the same card. She called back and forth with someone about the issue and was still having a problem, so after some chitchat, we sat back down and she said she'd be right back with me. In about 5 minutes, she called me up to the window and said that the doctor told her that I needed to go find a different doctor because of a review. Umm what??? So I asked her again to repeat what she said, she said the same thing and added the doctor didn't want to be my doctor anymore and that I should find someone else, that was it. She said she had never heard of anything like that before and by the look on her face was very embarrassed by the situation. 

All I can say is WOW! I was basically kicked out of the doctor's office for a review! Funny how convenient it was that after 20 minutes of insurance confusion she wants me to leave. Absolutely ridiculous! Never again!"
239,"Awful. Don't go there as an adult, don't bring your child there. Medical Arts has skilled Phlebotomists that know what they are doing. I brought my son to CPL several years ago, the Tech kept sticking him because they couldn't find his vein so I vowed to never bring him back. After that I took him to the lab on Medical Arts, they drew his blood perfectly first time, no problems, in and out, no anxiety for my kid. However, to save a trip and time (completely my fault) I decided to give CPL a 2nd chance. I told them from the moment I walked in there that I needed the best phlebotomist they had there to draw his blood and explained what happened the last time we visited. The 1st Tech stuck him 7 times and of course didn't draw his blood.  2nd Tech did it but it hurt him. Never again! I don't care what the situation is- dehydrated, can't see the veins whatever the case may be, if you know how to find someone's vein & enter it properly it will give you viles of blood instantly! If you can't draw blood on the 1st stick it shouldn't be your profession!"
240,"Never again! The front lady next to the second computer has so much attitude, acting like she doesn't want to be there, unable clearly communicate with patients and explain when and why insurance authorization is needed for the appointment. There are no doctors (gynecologists) in the office, only nurses, however, the insurance network shows that you can be seen by the doctor, but as a result, my doctor ended up being in Sarasota. After making the appointment and asking the staff ""if I will be able to see the doctor and obtain the referral for the ultrasound"", I was told ""yes"". Waiting for a month for my appointment and 1 hour in the office to be called, I was told by the nurse that they only do a pap smear and not even normal woman's check-up, in addition, they can't do a referral. These people should educate their staff on how to communicate with patients, so we don't waste time and can be aware in advance that they don't perform full woman's check-up."
241,"Dermatology Dept. was an awful experience. Made an appt. 2
months ago to have skin tags removed then waited over an hour to be seen.
The doctor confirmed I had skin tags that need to be removed BUT I was told
""we only do that at our Chestnut Hill office.""
Why wasn't I told that 2 months ago or in the office today before waiting an hour.
Seems like a scam to get 2 appts. out of one.
Never again!!!!!!!  And they couldn't care LESS !!"
242,"Terrible! I saw 2 doctors for my 11 day old son. Tried to give them the benefit of the doubt the 1st time but the 2nd visit was worse. I saw Dr. Soven who was Unprofessional,rude, rough with my child, lacked patient care for sure. Never again! Parents beware yes it's that bad!"
243,"NEVER AGAIN! NOR WILL I RECOMMEND ANYONE TO THIS MEDICAL CENTER!
I was referred to one of the Ophthalmologists here due to a surgery I should be having for my condition which causes a lot of irritation and burning to my eyes through out my days. Anyways, I had an appointment on 07/17/2019, doctor came in like he was in a rush, shook my hand and sat down and started asking what was going on. No ""Hi, how are you I am so and so"" just a handshake and straight to the questions. I am adamant that both of my eyes are effected from my condition but the doctor was sure only one eye was effected.....sorry sir I am the one who endures the pain each and everyday!! When my appointment was done the doctor told me that his surgical coordinator would call me that day or the next few days to schedule my surgery. it has been TWO MONTHS and not one single call, I said you know what it might be busy but I have worked in an Ophthalmology clinic before....never two months busy! So I decided if my health wasn't important enough than I will get a second opinion elsewhere. I sent a message to the member services so they can have me referred to someone else and GUESS WHAT HAPPENED A DAY AFTER!!!!!! I got a call to schedule my surgery :) THANKS BUT NO THANKS. it took me to send a complaint message for someone to care about my health?!?!?!? BYE!!!! I pay way to much money for insurance for my health not to be important!"
244,"Never again! My vet takes more time and better care of my dog! Kelli was great, Dr. Jukes needs to re-think her calling."
245,"I had Botox done on my forehead less than 3 months ago and am very DISAPPOINTED. I've called the place 3xs with them promising to get back to me, which they never did until I called yet again. Finally spoke to someone who said that this is normal. I've been having the same area treated for 5+ years and have never had such a botched injection and experience like this. NEVER AGAIN!!!"
246,"I am reviewing Dr. Michael Phillps not the entire office.  He was my daughter's doctor thru her pregnancy. She was a high risk pregnancy but even higher risk due to being pregnant with twins. She told me that he had anegative attitude towards her at every visit but I eventually saw it with my own eyes. My review is on what i witnessed. 
My daughter went into labor and she was only 22 weeks along. His approach to the situation was so harsh and rough! He came in giving condolences  with no plans to help the situation. He told her that this is a horrible situation and she was going to lose the babies. It really wasn't what he said but HOW he said it, it was such a harsh tone. husband spoke up and told him that was wrong of him to speak to her like that. There are plenty of babies who have survived being born that soon. The doctor said thats true but that would not be the case here. He never gave my daughter any medication in an attempt to slow or stop the labor. At the time she went into the hospital her cervix had started to open to 3 cm but waterbag was totally intact. 
Once the first baby was born, the first thing he did was to go over to my husband, not my daughter or her husband, but to my husband and patted him on the back and said he was sorry but the look on his face was like an i told you so look. My husband said dont touch him and my husband told the doctor that he didnt do anything to prevent this he just let it happen. The doctor then stepped into my husband face and tokd him to get out once my husband said we were going to sue him. Once my husband left the doctor told my daughter that he was sorry but that he (the doctor) was right. He said ""i'm sorry that i am right, but i am."" Doctor went on to mention several times that he was right. He then did something that was risky to my daughters life and the second baby, he left the first babys placenta inside her in hopes of keeping her pregnant longer. Why didnt he try to stop the labor from the very beginning, 12 hours earlier. What he did not work, we ended up losing the second baby as well. 
The doctor seems to have had a God complex. He kept saying he has been doing this a long time and he knew the outcome. But did he withhold something in order to prove he was right? Two babies are now gone and a family is heart broken, for what?"
247,"Absolutely love the classes and staff! Since I have scoliosis, there are some exercises that I need to modify. Trainers are very knowledgeable and have helped me figure out exactly what works for my body. Really the best gym in Austin!"
248,"What's a girl to do when an hour of sleep is a far and distant memory? Resort to addictive sleeping pills again? Drive around town like a sleepy drunk person? Take your father's advice and try some Chinese medicine? The latter!

My dad swears by acupuncture. He's been here many times over the years. He receives a discount for being a veteran and pays a mere $15. I receive a $10 discount for being employed by the State. I've been treated before (unofficially), but this was my first official experience, at the student clinic. My appointment was super late, and worked with my work schedule. Everything was explained to me fairly thoroughly. During this time, I had to completely reset my thinking in order to understand the Chinese way, versus Western medicine.

Unfortunately, I did not wear the appropriate clothing, so I had to take my pants off (awkward) and put on a hospital like gown with it open in the front. My ashy, hairy legs were on full display. Since I was so outwardly calm, yet internally FREAKED about the needles, he started with inserting a small needle into my ear, which was supposed to relax me. He was also very careful to take note of my reactions and wincing when the needles were inserted. I know everyone always says that acupuncture doesn't hurt and that you don't feel it. And while I agree that it doesn't hurt, I FEEL THAT SHIT! A needle goes into my arm, and my ring finger starts twitching. A needle goes somewhere on my back and my left butt cheek twitches without my permission. Once all 25+ needles were in place (after the supervisor approved his treatment plan for me), I laid still for about 25 minutes with the lights dimmed and my student acupuncturist checked on me a couple times. I appreciated this greatly as I tried to unsuccessfully relax. I accepted the recommendation for a ""formula"" of Chinese medicine and was shown where I could pick up my medicine. I still have no idea really what they gave me but I was willing to try anything. Is my insomnia cured? No, and I don't expect that. Acupuncture is not a cure, but an attempt to relieve symptoms with frequent visits expected to continue seeing progress. I get it. And I'll definitely be back."
249,"To the ""Doctors Who Think They Know Best,""

I literally walked out of the office on my 2nd visit and will NEVER GO BACK!  The front office staff were RUDE, the COST for services was EXCESSIVE (quoted me $800 for a bite guard and it really cost $300 from past my fancy, comestics only dentist), the doctors did not introduce themselves and they left me sitting in the treatment chair for 45+ minutes.

The DENTAL TOOLS were RUSTY!  The tray of scraping tools, mirror, etc were literally rusty and very old looking with wooden handles!  (Sound the exit music).

I was REQUIRED to have TWO appointments, with the first appointment to establish my ""treatment plan,"" but did not get any treatment on this day!  A totally waste of time for someone whom has never had a cavity and only needs a regular cleaning (as I repeatedly indicated).

Another issue of frustration was simply scheduling and being REQUIRED TO CALL BACK AND CONFIRM THE APPOINTMENT with a lenghty formal message about the $$$ fees incured should I ""fail to confirm"" the appointment!  Front office staff were RUDE and abrupt, similar to all of the staff in general.

I pleasantly introduced myself to the masked dental tech and she rudely replied ""yeah, I know I saw you (2 weeks ago) last time!""  Ummm, she was waring a MASK on her face, give me a break!  This interaction was 

My dental coverage is not worth this experience.

UPDATE:  See my review of Rose Dental.  09/2009"
250,"Reagan is AMAZING at Voluma. My cheeks look so natural and I look like I've gotten a good night's sleep (never happens in the film industry.) Sarah is wonderful at skin. Shannon is quality for lips. All these women actually are really quite skilled and ALSO fun to hang out with! I came in with questions and not only did they answer in detail, but they suggested better things I wasn't even aware of for my skin. I also love the amenities of the office itself. Water, coffee, calm atmosphere. I rarely have to wait, and they ladies are the front desk are goddesses at making sure you use your Brilliant Distinctions points and discounts. (And also at handling my psycho schedule.) 

I've been going here for a few months and it's my new favorite place- completely worth the 30-40 minute drive from Norcross."
251,"Yelpers you got it right! 

Since 2014 my husband has been going to Great Expressions. 
Yes, the staff is welcoming and friendly, his hygienist does excellent work, even Dr. Tudor takes pride in his job (flash visits though). But Great Expressions needs to do better!

He did have a legitimate procedure done to his gum at one point. They handled it well from start to finish, even making follow up calls to ensure he was doing well.  If it wasn't for that they would have received 1 star. 

These were some of his issues with Great Expressions;
1. Ridiculous wait time- plan on waiting at least 30-40 minutes minimum even with a scheduled appointment.
2. Overcharging- he had a substantial credit on his account at least twice and ONLY because of this he continued to go.
3. Constant unnecessary appointment- expect visits every 3 months just for cleanings (In my opinion, bi-annual cleanings and check ups are more than enough)

Overall, his issue is largely with the Great Expressions franchise. It seems as though they are always trying to upsell you or make you believe that you need procedures that you don't really need.  Now, we are no experts on dental care by any means but, on one of his visits for a routine cleaning, they presented him with a statement of charges for additional work that was to be performed and requested that he signed off on it.  After carefully inspecting the bill and the amount to be paid AFTER insurance he respectfully told the hygienist that he couldn't agree to that price. There were at least 4 different procedures on the list so the hygienist told him that she could remove 2 of the procedures (basically an advanced mouthwash and a 'special' type of fluoride)... unnecessary!?! 

Again, great staff but, I do believe it's a corporate push to get the most money out of you."
252,I went to Katie for stress. She has given me some very good tools to use and I have been practicing using them in all situations and I think I am getting pretty good at it. She cuts to the core of your problems and gives you great insight into what you can change.
253,"I had filler done almost a year ago (in the second picture) it turned out great, the full face is the day after picture. yesterday I had mini filler done and my lips look horrible( lip picture), they are so beyond swollen and hard. I have emailed and will be calling as soon as they are open. I have followed all of the after care instructions and they are extremely swollen and hard. they look ridiculous. I can't go to work like this on Monday. Worst experience ever and I don't even know how it can be fixed or un-done."
254,"Went here in severe pain. Waited at urgent care for an hour without even being checked in or asked what my problem was. How is that legal? I have worked in health care for more than twenty five years. I have never seen anything like it. Old man next to me said he waited two hours to be checked in. I asked the lady how they can have all these people sitting around not knowing if they are dieing, just have the flu and how they triage the severity. She said they don't . if this where anywhere but Lynn it would be unacceptable. I know I have worked at several hospitals and been to hundreds of hospitals and health centers as an EMT. I had to leave and go to Union hospital where I received prompt car and was checked in right away.  This is an example of the haves and have nots and what gets me is why all those people and the facility think it is acceptable to wait that long just to be checked in. I am from Somerville originally and I can tell you it would not be tolerated. I wonder how many people sit there with chest pain thinking its there only option for care. It pretty much is for most living in poverty in Lynn."
255,"I've had a few interactions with Austin Surgical Arts that left me with many conflicting opinions.  Judge for yourself...it was pretty hard for me to rank these guys.

Background story: My dentist recommended I have my remaining wisdom teeth (3 left) surgically removed.  They wrote me up a referral to ASA and I call them up to schedule an appointment.

My initial phone call was a dreadful experience.  Whomever answered my call was very rude and treated me like I was a slow child.  I came into this phone call knowing I was supposed to make an appointment with these people.  I did not know a consultation was required.  My dentist had written up the extraction information on the referral and I stupidly thought that would be enough.  After my scolding from the receptionist, I made my appointment.  I gave her the name of the my referring dentist and that action took about 5 minutes.  I spelled out my dentist's name for her about 6 times and she got very angry.  Then she asked if I was reading a signature or a printed name.  Seriously?  I was very close to cancelling my appointment at the end of this call.  But I went ahead and went thru with it, praying the surgeons were not as nasty as the front desk staff.

On the day of my consultation, I spend a good amount of time filling out paperwork.  There is some confusion about insurance as I am using my husband's and not my own.  The girl gets a bit snotty with me and I decide to stop smiling and be a bitch right back.  It works.  The condescending tone stops.  Ha!

Dr. Kristovich was very kind and informative.  Once the consultation began, she gave me any piece of information I could ever need in regards to what to expect before, during and after surgery.  She was friendly and asked me questions not pertaining to my teeth.  Right off the bat she said I would feel better with twilight sedation and I agreed.  They would basically sedate me with a pill beforehand, then laughing gas, then an IV and then shots.  I couldn't have asked for a better way to spend an hour!  Too bad cocktails weren't included.

As I was paying for the x-rays, the front desk girls become very friendly with me.  I don't know what started it.  They noticed my ring and ask me about it.   I told them the background on it and we start talking about my husband and Match.com.  They are being eerily nice and sweet to me and asking me all these questions.  I leave confused.

Surgery day goes well.  I walk in drugged up and relaxed.  I get to the room, get a warm blanket and we all make chit chat.  They start the IV (which goes in with ease) and I take a nice, hour long nap.  My friend and I get the post-op instructions and that's it folks.  

I still can't figure out my true opinion of ASA.  The front desk gets bad stars from me.  My first impression and first contact were not warm fuzzy memories.  But my surgeon was awesome.  She did a very good job of keeping me informed and at ease.  Basically, that's all that matters."
256,"Before I moved to Miami to care for my mother with Alzheimers Dr. Kay Entrekin was my GYN.  She was wonderful, and upon my return to Decatur after mom passed I called for a well-woman appointment, pap and all that.  I was informed that they no longer take Medicare.....I guess there's no money to be made in my age group.  Very disappointing that they are not an age-inclusive practice."
257,"He's the best!!  My urologist and family doctor did not know the answer.  Dr Rachal took one look and diagnosed it on the spot.

The other two doctors did not even know who to go to for the answer."
258,"Kristine Aadland is my dream dentist.  I don't like dentists and have had some bad experiences with them.  And, I legitimately have reason to fear dental work because I have a heart condition that makes me unable to have epinephrine, which is one of the main ingredients in the most commonly used dental anesthetic, and the one which makes the numbing last longer.  So, I can only have the short acting type of anesthetic, which means the dentist has to be on point with the process, and reinject me when needed.  No fun for anyone, and for some reason it puts most dentists off.  I've actually had a few of them get mad at me because of it, and regardless of the fact that my cardiologist says I cannot have this type of anesthetic, they think I'm being a baby.  On top of that, I'm almost neurotically fearful of the sensation when they hit the nerve (you know what I'm talking about if you've had it), because I had a dentist drill into an abscessing tooth once, and the nerve sensation was about 2 million on a scale of 1-10.  All this boils down to my being afraid of dentists.  And, woe is me, I needed some dental work done.  Enter Kristine Aadland, who is kind, gentle, smart and has a sense of humor.  I explained the situation to her and it didn't ruffle her feathers in the least.  Her main concern was my comfort and well being -- I know, it's a novel concept for most dentists, but it's true!  So, I had to have some pretty extensive work done, and it didn't hurt.  Read that again and breathe in the revelation:  IT DIDN'T HURT.  The entire clinic is first rate in terms of equipment, cleanliness, comfort, staff -- there is nothing wrong with any of it.  I'm searching in my brain for a ""con,"" so my review doesn't sound cagey, but I can't find a thing.  They even make the crowns on site, so I sat there and read while it was created (and watched it being done for a while -- way cool, for real).  Meaning, there is no having a temp crown put on and then waiting a week or two to get the real thing put in, it's done the day you go.  You can watch movies while the work is being done (I don't, I'm way too nervous for that), they give you water or juice, people are nice and funny, and Kristine's behavior is more like a friend that happens to be working on your teeth than a dentist (with that off-putting dentist 'tude that is so rampant in that profession).  I've had a couple of nice dentists before, but there was always something wrong.  There is nothing wrong with Kristine Aadland and her dental clinic -- without reservation I can say that they will go above and beyond the call of duty to create a stress free dental experience.  I've had quite a bit of work done already, and will be finishing up the work shortly.  In all sincerity, I never thought I'd have the courage to get my teeth completely fixed, but having discovered this dentist I am doing it.  I know this is a long review, but other dental-phobes will appreciate it.  Have courage, fellow dental-phobes and take my word for it -- this dentist will alleviate your dental fears!"
259,"3 visits, nearly $600 dollars to have a small piece of skin cancer removed. its already looking to leave a bad scare and the area of surgery, my nose, tingles to the touch now, I think they damaged nerve. never again. they should tell you the cost up front like dentist do. that thing would have just stayed there. what a bunch of bull for some thing that don't spread is scaring and have lost most feeling there."
260,"DON'T do it. I have always taken care of my teeth and have always liked going to the dentist until I started going to Advanced Dental. I had gone over the course of 2 years for my cleaning and was never particularly pleased with the service. 

No matter what time your appt is you WILL be waiting forever and late for any obligations you have that day.

I finally called it quits when I made the first appt of the day, sat there for at least 30 minutes before getting called back to the chair where I sat unseen for ANOTHER 20-30 minutes. Some tech came over to brush my teeth but didn't speak to me but to mutter the words ""ok someone will be right with you"" ok great - here we go. No, another tech ended up by my chair to CLEAN MY TEETH AGAIN?

So now I'm wicked confused - wth is going on, the first person didn't speak to me now the second person is coming over to do the same S@#! and is able to speak. Then the dentist comes over does his thing, leaves. Some other person comes over and finally I'm like enough - who are you?! and what's going on - is there something wrong?!! ""no maam i'm just here to take a look. OK you're all set""

Never again. I was there all in all for 2 hours for a cleaning. Their communication among staff is lacking. There are barely any partician walls to add privacy and can hear everyone drilling away. 

I wish so badly I could still fly home to PA and just go back to my dentist there every 6 months. Their office was decorated, it was calming with bamboo and tranquil color schemes not to mention nice fish tanks where Advanced Dental is the exact opposite.

Not my cup of tea and i'm sure there are better run offices around Orlando."
261,"I just had an infuriating experience with Zoom, and I will never make an appointment with this company again. I scheduled a 1pm dental appointment and arrived at exactly 1:02pm. After being greeted, the young lady at the front desk asked how I intended to pay for the visit. This is where the trouble began. My employer has a self-funded/self-insured dental plan, meaning they pay 100% of cleanings and x-rays every 6 months. Thus, I go to the dentist, they bill the company, and the company pays the dentist. After explaining this, with declarations page detailing the plan in hand, I was given a puzzled/worried look. ""How do we enter this? We don't have enough time to verify this, as you're running late (let's recall that it's 1:02 for a 1:00 appointment)."" How complicated can this be? You clean my teeth and take pictures, then send a bill to my employer. If they fail to pay this bill for any reason, you have all of my information (address, phone number, email address, etc.). This is not a complicated transaction, but thank you for wasting my time. You have a website, an app, and a fancy storefront, but you can't handle the most basic of interactions. Never again."
262,"NEVER AGAIN.  *never*.

FIrst, I made the appointment for two cleanings and gave them the insurance information for both myself and my husband.  They didn't call on them until AFTER the appointment .. and of course.. there was a problem.

They did a ""special"" cleaning and didn't tell us until we got to the counter to pay, $111 more than I had anticipated.

They asked several times if we were getting the ""Groupon Special"".  They keep their appointment book (phone numbers included) on a computer screen in each room where everyone can see it.  Not okay.

I was 7 months pregnant  at the time and they insisted on x-rays, which I declined for the current visit.  When the dentist came in and asked why I didn't have them taken the hygentist told him it was because ""she *thinks* she's pregnant"".  I was extremely nervous being at the dentist so when they took my blood pressure, it was slightly elevated.  I was told that ""it was understandable since I was obviously overweight"". 7 months pregnant, jerk!!!

Fast forward 4 months later, I decided to have a crown and some fillings done because it seemed convenient since they had all of my information.  I don't know why I thought this was a good idea.  Luckily, they refuse to return my phone calls in order to set up the appointment."
263,"My second visit with my teenager.  First visit was quick and painless and that's why I just went back.  Never again. Customer service was terrible.  We were told test results would be back at a certain time, called for results and was told a different story. Talked to a different person each day I called to get results and the information kept changing.  Finally when they did call with the results, the person was rude and not forthcoming with any information - it was hard to believe they knew what they were doing. The staff does not exude trust. In the meantime, had to bring my teen to another clinic and it was an exact opposite experience."
264,"After having seen Dr. Green for quite some time, I am officially finished with her.  I am in complete shock after today's appointment.  I have been on Yaz for five years, and it has worked perfectly for me.  Over the past six months, however, Dr. Green, upon urging her twice, did not write ""no substitution"" on my prescriptions, thereby leaving me with a generic brand of birth control.  

I understand that it is state law to give patients generics first, upon their availability, but that should not be enforced when the patient refuses a generic, like in my case.  I understand the concept of generic drugs, but in the case of birth control, where hormonal levels are in question, especially when there is absolutely NOTHING wrong with Yaz, I refuse to not only potentially deal with the side effects of a generic but also with the stress of expecting those side effects.

Dr. Green did not understand me at all.  Her words to me literally were,""Well, that's the system, and it works for me.  Take the generic, and if you hate it after two months, I will prescribe you Yaz again.  But I need to keep up my rating and I don't want to be fined if I prescribe you Yaz and not the generic first.""  I was shocked!!  I felt as my doctor, she was not on my side at all!  She only cared about her rating and not being fined!!!!  She also told me that if I don't comply, I can go see another gynecologist.

Absolutely horrible.  Since when am I the last to be asked what goes into my body?????  When I asked her if she is recommending the generic because she thinks it might work better, her answer was, ""no, I just don't want to get fined.  That's the system.  It works for me.""

What a disappointment.  I do not recommend this doctor, even though, before today, I had recommended her to two other friends.  This is certainly not what a gynecologist should be like.  She has clearly forgotten the meaning of ""In each house I go, I go for the good of my patients.""  She needs to be reminded of that.

Never again.  After today's appointment, I have indeed found someone new."
265,"I went to Dr. Benjamin Havemann back in 2013 where is was obnoxious, rude to me and my husband, in a hurry and gave me no follow up. I avoided him until I ended up in ER in 2017 and was referred to him for stomach pain.
AVOID. AVOID. AVOID.. 
He actually says POO instead of bowel movement, BM or defecation. HE SAID POO AT LEAST TEN TIMES DURING THE VISIT. So condescending. Sickening. 
His diagnosis are not written in medical terms but says things like ""all over the map"".  He is offensive, ill mannered, crude, and has infantile terminology and has no time to listen but looks at the time while tapping his foot.
He is very arrogant. He screamed LISTEN TO ME, along w screaming POO and also said I should get a second opinion. 
He basically wanted my copay and had only 15 minutes and no time to waste on a Mexican woman with a cyclic bloating issue. 
Sadly I was referred to this conceited doctor by ER. I should of known better from his reputation in this area not to go to him. Never again. Please message me if you want the full details."
266,"The dentist my daughter and I saw has no bedside manner. She needed a simple filling which she has had at 2 other dentists with no issues. Here she's in a lot of pain and tears because this guy and his assistant are incompetent. The assistant applied the numbing agent in the wrong place so the novacaine shot was quite painful. 

For me, I was on a follow up appointment to get a mouthguard for sleeping.  It was way off fitwise and their solution, cram it in.. make it fit. When I let them know it was very painful they got pissy with me and the dentist said ""there's gonna be some pressure"" all in a snotty attitude like it's my fault they suck at their job. I got up out of the chair and walked out on the spot.

I have had broken bones and lacerations requiring stitches and gotten through it like a champ. The only reason I came here in the first place is because they take my insurance. NEVER AGAIN. I would rather pay out of pocket then deal with uncaring people."
267,"My infant daughter had a fever of over 103 so I rushed over here as it was closer than the hospital ER. Wrong decision. There was no one waiting - as I had hoped.

I handed my insurance card to the reception and they wanted a bunch of forms filled out before seeing a very sick little girl. I insisted on please seeing a doctor while they could enter all the info on the card. No. ""We have procedures"".

I was not exactly in a position to fill out a bunch of forms while holding a crying, sick infant and saw these ""procedures"" very clearly for what they are - cash before care, profit before people.

Grabbed my card back and ran out of there to get the care she needed fast. 

The name of the place includes the word ""emergency"" in it. I don't think their priority is patient care but getting paid and they certainly didn't treat the emergency as an emergency.

Over at the very busy hospital ER she was seen in 10 minutes with just her name, my signature, and my SSN. There were a bunch of forms to fill there too but they took care of that after addressing the emergency.

Bad business model. Never again."
268,"I've had several very poor experiences with Dr Pamee Shaw at Sunny Days Dental. I've had 3 crowns in the past 9 months from her.

- While working on one tooth, she accidentally broke an adjacent crown which then had to be replaced immediately. And she insisted that I had to pay for it. She said it needed to be replaced anyway. Well maybe it did but that did not give her permission to accidentally break it.

- While drilling on a tooth it became apparent that the nerve was not sufficiently numbed, so she injected additional novocaine 2 or 3 times and went immediately back to drilling, yet the tooth/nerve still remained sensitive to me when she drilled on it. Afterward I asked why she had so much trouble deadening the tooth and she said well you have to give the novocaine time to act. I was appalled - why didn't she give it time before drilling again? And again? In hindsight I knew this, but I assumed that she knew what she was doing so I didn't question it. 

- The last time she was drilling on a tooth and she accidentally poked my cheek with the drill. I could literally feel the flesh being pulled out of my cheek.  When I looked at it there was just a tiny hole in my cheek, not very deep. But it did bleed and it was painful for a few days.  That was the last straw. Never again.

- Now I just found out that, over the past 9 months I have been paying additional fees that my insurance eventually reimbursed for... to the tune of $800. Sunny Days is now refunding me the $800 but I was out the $800 for several months. So be aware that they appear to make a practice of billing the customer then reimbursing if/when insurance covers it.

Since she seems to be in business I'm sure that she is normally a good dentist. But I post this with all sincerity and honesty. I have not had a good experience with Dr Shah."
269,"Never again. I already didn't care for the doctor because she was trying to convince me that I was fine when I knew I wasn't at a prior appt. 

My appt was for 3 pm. I called at 2:59 pm and 3:07 pm to say I would be within the grace period. I called twice because I kept getting the operator who relayed unclear messages to them about my travel updates, prompting the nurse to prematurely tell me to reschedule when I was on the way. 

I arrive at 3:17 pm, would have been there by the grace period had the signage been better for the elevators. Only for the nurse to ""claim"" that the operator said I would take 15-20 minutes (not true) and that I needed to reschedule and that they were ""backed up."" Not one soul was on the waiting room when I arrived. When I spoke to the nurse she was attitudinal and claimed that because I was 2 minutes late there was no way possible to be seen. Seriously?! It was clear they were not honoring the grace period regardless. They lack compassion and it's clear I'm not the only person who shares this sentiment. Do not go to this Atlanta Gastro!"
270,"Started seeing Dr. Mui again this spring.  I got shin splints and even though I stopped running for 3 weeks, they still hurt.  Went to see Dr. Mui and they improved significantly in the first couple of visits.  I continued to see him and I was able to run and continued to see improvement.  

My only regret?  Not calling Dr. Mui as soon as I had something that hurt.  I lost 3 weeks of training due to me being stubborn and not wanting to go see someone about it.  Never again.  As soon as something hurts going forward, he'll be my first call."
271,"Waiting room like cattle herded into a pen.  Staff slow and unresponsive.   I've had experience with Tx Onc before.  Out of three doctors only one was truthful and forthright.   Other two were awful.  The last one said he had no idea how the treatment plan was working because my chart had not been updated for six months, even though I had monthly appointments.  Never again."
272,"We took an elderly friend (she's 85) in a wheelchair to get new glasses. After her exam, they took her glasses and told her it would be about an hour for a new pair of monofocal reading glasses. At the end of the hour, they had hardly started, apparently, because we didn't get them for another hour. (This is a woman with a bathroom problem.) 

She picked out frames for a pair of varifocal glasses and was told they would be mailed to her and she should have them in 10 days. That was 17 days ago. I phoned the company to inquire and was told that the glasses were shipped to the Medford office, but they ""didn't pass inspection"" and had to be returned. She refused to tell me how long it would take -- she kept saying ""a few more days."" Tell THAT to an old lady who can't see. 

Never again."
273,"Rude, uninterested/unnatentive staff. From recepcionist to doctor. The front desk girl was in a bad mood or something, barely talked, didn't even answered a ""good mooring"" When they got to check my blood pressure, whatever that it is they use wasn't working, they didn't do anything about it, so they didn't know my BP,not that I care, nor I know if it is crucial to know it. After all, I knew I just needed prescription for amoxollin or some antibiotic for my ear/throat infection so at some point I just didn't care, just wanted to get my prescription and get out of there. I ask he doctor a couple of questions (I wanted to know if they were related to my throat infection), and he seemed very bothered and just offered to refer me to another doctor, whatever. (note that I was the only one patient at the time, he spent less than 5 min w me, seriously)Even when I had to pay, the same girl that couldn't even answer my ""good mooring"" earlier, again was just acting like she was doing me a favor. At that point I just gave her my credit card, I  was ready to get out of there.  A ""thank you, have a good day""?, no, not a single word, just gave me a receipt, not a single word. Whatever. They called me the next day to ask me how everything was and asked If I had any questions, I told the lady what happened, And that I actually asked questions to the doctor, that he didn't really answer/wanted to answer...there was an awkward 8/10 sec pause... After that, I mentioned that I already made an appointment elsewhere, and that I ""didn't have any questions""...her answer?,  ""Ok, I hope you feel better"". lol. Never again. And I hope they don't answer to this review with all the ""I'm sorry you had a bad experience yaddee yadda"", they should have done something when I first let them know on the phone. There's Concentra right across the highway."
274,This practice is horrible. Everything from the receptionist to the doctors are not up to par. They give off an i-don't-care attitude. Not professional and my issue is still not solved!!! There is no way i will ever return here. I gave this practice two chances to prove me wrong. Never again.
275,"The visits are great until after surgery.  I do not like that you only meet the Dr the day of surgery, and then never again.  Now if you pay cash it's 10G's, but Lord help you if you use your insurance they attempt to bill 60G;s.  Total rip off.  I have nothing against the staff, but this is a major procedure and the Dr needs to be more involved.  Had I know then what I know now, I would have not done the band, but the sleeve.  I need this thing out and now!"
276,"So far in my trips to Lenscrafters I have had to bring one pair of glasses 3 times because the coating kept peeling.  This round (yes, I went back, silly me) It took me about 12 hours of work to get three pairs of glasses back.  First I had two visits with the optician and I still felt I couldn't see well.  So, I went to another optician and found the lenscrafters' prescription was incorrect.  I then had to deal with scratched lenses,  and other delays.  The staff was lovely, however, the product is terrible.  Never again."
277,Girl at the front desk had no clue what she was doing. Practice is unorganized and rude. My sick son needed to be seen and I was so overwhelmed by the unwelcoming staff that I just left. Never again.
278,"My wife and I have had the most trying and difficult experience with this office. It started with the doctor making what we believe to be an incorrect diagnosis, then mid procedure changing his course of action and doing another procedure that was not needed, and then billing us for it. After much argument, they sent us a threatening letter stating that if not paid in full, the bill would be sent to collections. We decided just to pay the bill because the cost of fighting it in court would just be too high. We then set up a payment arrangement for the next 6 months. They took the first payment and then sent another letter threatening collection. After contacting them they said that a payment arrangement was never made, but they would be willing to do a two month payment plan. With no choice but to agree, we paid it. Never again. Stay away."
279,"I would give her no stars but that is not an option. I will start with the first impression. You walk in and the 2 gals at the front desk are young and immature. They talk WAY too loud, so there is no sense of privacy at all. I found the exam rooms to be set up strangely, you change right in front of the door, and they don't knock to confirm it's okay to come in, so anyone walking by gets a free show. The rooms are not clean. There were no towels for the Dr to dry her hands, but I suppose she would have had to wash them first. No hand sanitizer either. Nothing was sterile at all. And it's worse when you have to give a urine sample- the cups for collection are in the bathroom for anyone to contaminate. I had to call 3 separate times to get my prescriptions transferred over ( I waited a week in between each call), 2 times for her to call in for referrals (still not done, but at this point, it doesn't matter) and 3 separate times to get my lab results (called once a week for 3 weeks).I gave them plenty of time to get me these things- it's been over a month! AND when I called, no one that answered the phone tried to verify who I was before giving me information. They even told me what my birthday was and asked me to confirm if that was correct. I could have been anyone calling in for my records. Funny thing is that 2 of my friends referred her to me so I went without looking at reviews, never again. I actually don't have anything good or redeeming about this office. I actually looking into making a formal complaint with the Department of Public Health because of how unsterile and dirty that office is, but it doesn't appear that they take those kinds of complaints. Stay away, stay very far away."
280,"I have two separate experiences here; both of them negative. One was for a Columbus Outlet online deal. It completely misrepresented the price. It was 10x higher than what was promised. The ""doctor"" came in only after my insistence that I should get what I had paid for and proof of it in writing with my printed deal. They wouldn't budge but gave me some filler at a ""discount"" and sent me on my way.

Recently I have been shopping Ulta Therapy procedures and wanted to see what Monarch's price was. After waiting a few weeks to get an appt. with Jill (on my day off/my birthday), I went in only to hear I wasn't on the calendar. This, after a confirmation phone call Friday with a plug for flu shots. 

Seriously???Never again. Shame on me for being so naive."
281,"Urgent care here is a joke. I went for an ovarian cyst that burst a year and a half ago, Dr. Crisan asked me what my pain was when it burst and I said a 9, she pretty much threw all her stuff and said you need to go to the ER and wouldn't do anything to see me right then. So now I am currently 15 weeks pregnant and was having abdominal pains, saw a doctor on Friday she said to take a laxative and let them know if my pain subsided. It didn't, so I went back Saturday morning, saw Dr. Gina McKenzie, she insisted that my pregnancy had developed into a tubal pregnancy? Even though I had an excellent ultrasound a week prior to this. She said I needed to go to the ER to get an ultrasound to see if it's a tubal pregnancy which doesn't make any sense to me. Anyways, she proceeds to tell me her cousin died from a tubal pregnancy and when I said I wasn't sure yet if I was going to visit the ER due to financial issues, she responded with 'so you're okay having a miscarriage?' She was just extremely rude with everything she said and didn't even try to see if maybe something else was going on. Once I got home, a few hours later she called with blood results which said I had a high WBC and I need to go the ER RIGHT NOW. I then proceeded to the ER. The doctor in there ends up telling me to disregard everything that urgent care had told me and to calm down because high WBC are normal during pregnancy and nothing to worry about. Everything ended up being fine and my symptoms are just a normal part of pregnancy. So if you're still reading, they just have wasted my time and money and try to rush you off to the ER. I think I will avoid this urgent care and I would never see this doctor again. She was horrible and very rude to me. Never again."
282,"I just had the worst experience at this place and I'd love to tell you about how great Dr. Guyden is but after THREE HOURS of waiting I never got the chance to work with her. Making the appointment was fine. They left me a voicemail requesting a phone number for my insureance company. I call back,  talk to a gal from the central business office who transfers me to a woman at the Northlake office. She was so slow and unintelligible that it took minutes for her to spell my name, with me resorting to spelling through ""Alpha Nancy Sam Yankee..."". After convincing her I really did have an appointment on Thursday,  yes this Thursday because I just got the automated confirmation service,  after that,  she TRANSFERRED ME BACK to the central office,  where I had to leave a message.
Day of,  I'm running 5 minutes late so I call and Ms. Judy is very considerate. I follow the map on their website to the WRONG 2300 building,  which makes me 30 minutes late. I'm assured that they can fit me in Dr. Guyden's schedule but to my original statement,  THREE HOURS OF WAITING and no luck. I had a nice assistant check on me about twenty minutes into sitting in the exam room and at some point I stepped out to ask for water. The doctor acknowledged me and promised she was trying to get to me... but alas.
At what point do you think you say,  ""Know what, it is actually impossible I will have the time for a new patient exam since it's already 30 minutes after closing time. Maybe we should let that woman in the exam room know!"" 
I'm 30 late. Got it. So I deserve a 3 hour punishment? I'm also the sucker who stayed. I already took the time off work,  made arrangements for someone to pick up my daughter after kindergarten, and sat there. The Dr. left a personal message later that night to apologize but the damage is done. NEVER AGAIN. FIND SOMEWHERE ELSE. Somewhere you'll be treated with a little tlc and respect."
283,"Literally the worst doctor I've ever been to in my life. I had an appointment for an eye infection- weepy, very sensitive to light. The doctor left me in a BRIGHTLY lit room for an HOUR AND A HALF. She didn't give me a diagnosis, and clearly didn't give a crap. She sent me away with free eye drop samples. Wtf. I had to go see a real doctor the next day. Oh, and they tried to charge me two hundred dollars. When I disputed it, they still charged me a hundred for doing nothing but making me hurt worse then I did before. Never again."
284,"This review is going to link to the Orthopaedic Clinic of the Boston Medical Center. It's their fault I am writing this review in the first place. 

I was admitted here after a bunch of douche rockets at BMC failed to advise about the possibility of, check for, or diagnose blood clots as a result of a prolonged leg cast. Even after I told them i was in pain and having trouble breathing. Anyway. 

The *doctors* at Cambridge Hospital were relatively competent; they diagnosed my situation relatively quickly. I was pretty satisfied with the fact that I had two pulmonary embolisms, and a right-side pneumonia and didn't, you know, *die*. 

It's everything else about the hospital that pissed me off. I tried to get a B-Reader to take a look at my chest film at 6:00 p.m. on a Thursday. Yeah. Might as well have asked Sister Mary McConnell if she wanted a quick tumble out in the servant's quarters. 

So I had to check myself into the ER and wait. Fortunately my PCP was greasing the wheels, so I only had to wait an hour, instead of the six that was projected. Rules are rules, and in a hospital ER, if you're not bleeding on the floor, you're not a priority. 

The CT scan tech was an *asshole*. Straight up, fake blonde from Everett, doesn't give a shit about people, just operates a machine for a living. Here's a guy in his 30s, trying to tough it out, and comes close to passing out twice from pain, says ""I can't lie down, it's killing me."" Now, to most people this says ""Hey, this guy needs some help or something."" To Bottleblond McNorthshore it's just an excuse to whip out her Customer Service voice and say ""mmmkay, can ya just try one more, kaaay?"" 

I was biting off screams on the damn table.  After ten minutes of this I sat up and told her she was going to have to get security to hold me down if she wanted more films. At THAT point she suggested: ""how about if we got you some more pain meds, would that help?

Genius, you antipathic cow.  Of course, god forbid the PATIENT suggests that lest they be instantly labeled a drug seeker and thereafter receive nothing more than ibuprofen. (Cue all the self-righteous comments from health-care workers about all the druggies they have to deal with)

The vacant-eyed golem that wheeled me back again managed to go to the wrong floor twice, despite having been the same person that brought me down there in the first place.

I got a ""room"" at 1:30 in the morning. I use quotes because what I got was the third bed in a room that had previously been a double.  They made it into a triple by pushing some furniture into a corner, sticking another craftmatic in there and another sliding curtain. My ""room was 6' x 9'.  I was sharing it with a lovely old man who was a great dude, and a REAL drug seeking narcotics addict who they tried to discharge twice *because there was nothing they could treat him for"".  

Ugh. Never again."
285,"Terrible! I've gone there twice and never again. This place feels like McDentists. The first time I received a cleaning and the technician was trying to sell me on the deep cleaning about 10 times even though I told her I cannot afford it, she put me through the worse pain I have ever endured during a cleaning and I go to the dentist regularly. The second time I came in my dentist was apparently already replaced by somebody else. The technician was using the spit sucker on my mouth to the point where my mouth and tongue hurt. I had to tell him to stop I didn't have any more spit left.  I had my cavity work done which was about the same as anywhere else then get home and the cosmetic binding on my front teeth is completely gone! Never again.."
286,"Do not waste your time. Dr Raumond is nice enough, but office staff is terrible. Had one video appt, and went to pick up sample meds. Sat in the car for 40 minutes, and no one ever came out. Called and sat on hold for 10 minutes more, and when they answered. I attempted to cancel my next appt. Waa put back on hold immediately. Rude folks, no customer care. Never again."
287,"By far the worst urgent care i've ever gone to. They overcharge and don't know what they're doing. I had to get x-rays done which was not actually needed. The ""doctors"" there clearly just want you to spend more money. If possible, do not go here ever. Never again. Thanks for nothing!"
288,"This was my second MRI.  During the first one (at another business), I felt air circulating, I could still see the room, and the tech said things like, ""Are you doing OK?""  or  ""You're doing great; we're halfway done.""  or  ""I'm right here. Everything is going great.""   

BUT for this MRI at Westlake, I was in what felt like a plastic box with small cage over my face (envision a baseball catcher's mask), no air circulating, and NO tech saying a word except, ""OK, 5 more minutes. Are you alright?""  ""I'm not happy, but.....""  I said.  NO REPLY.  Not an ""I hear ya.  Hang in there.""   Nothing.  The space was small and tubular so that my arms were pinned to my side and my face was a few inches from the ""ceiling"" of the plastic tube.  Also, the intermittent noises were LOUD on both sides of me, and the earphones tuned to 95.5 did nothing to squelch the loud booms.  An additional feature adding to the discomfort was the heavy vibration of my little space capsule (i.e., ""coffin""...yeah, my brain went there).  I feel sorry for the people living through the ""horse and buggy"" days.

Don't go here for an MRI.  15-20 minutes seemed like forever with no compassion shown, no reassurance, no contact until it was almost over.  I have had five babies, 3 with no drugs, so I am a strong lady, but this was like being put through a bit of torture.  My children and I have all experienced better....much better elsewhere.  Never again.

In the future, should I need an MRI, I will RESEARCH first for a facility that uses Open MRI or at least one with a NEWER machine with a LARGER opening....and they DO exist, and they're QUIETER and don't throw you around like a carnival ride (Ok, I exaggerate the movement; more like an obnoxious, vibrating hard slab---oh yeah, all spas have 'em, and people clamor to sign up.)

OK, people.  You've been WARNED. I wish I had been!  XO"
289,"My implant was a nightmare from beginning to completion.  When I finally got the implant after a year of having to wear a device  that prohibited my speaking ability, made dinner engagements ridiculous and constant pain, my tooth next to the implant is in trouble due to the implant.  After almost 8,000 dollars I regret the day I ever walked in the office.  The other issues I won't go into here regarding his poor listening and revolving staff members over one year are a reflection of the practice.  NEVER again.  NEVER offered a refund for the failure (of which technique is a cause of failure) but continued to ask me if I wanted to go forward.  I told him...you already have my money!!! What else could I do?  Pay another several thousand for a bridge?"
290,"This was my second visit for an MRI and it was worlds apart from the first.  With the exception of the friendly and helpful front desk person, the experience was shocking.  The two female techs were robotic in that questions were answered abruptly, my husband was treated rudely in the waiting area and it is NOT a place I would recommend ever again.  Ladies, you were NOT doing us a favor.  You were doing your job.  I would give the equipment and front desk blond person 5 Stars.  The techs I would give a 3 to the one who did my procedure and a one to the tech who interacted with my husband in the waiting area.  Never again."
291,Dr Levine is very unprofessional. I also work in the medical field so this comment is frpm another medical professional. He wss rude and condescending. Never again.
292,"My normal MD was unavailable so I stopped in to this Urgent Care location. I have a history of asthma and fight sinus infections and bronchitis about 4-5 times a year. I always go in at the first sign because of this to try to shorten the lifespan and control the asthma.

After a 2 hour wait in the waiting room, I was finally taken to a room. I didn't have to wait too long for the MD and for that I was thankful. The doctor starts asking the normal questions and I respond to him with my symptoms as well as my history. He looks in my throat and says, ""did you say your throat hurt?"" to which I responded, ""yes, I assume from the drainage."" He replies, ""Are you sure? It's not red."" Yes. Regardless of the color of my throat, I am not lying when I say it hurts.

He didn't listen to anything I said and just kept saying, ""Bronchitis is viral. You don't need antibiotics."" Yes, I am aware of that and never asked for them.

He finally offered me a breathing treatment (even though he had already boasted that I wasn't wheezing), which I declined because I have a nebulizer at home. He finally, after much convincing from me, gave me a steroid shot and sent me home, recommending OTC cough medicine and tylenol.

He treated me like I wasn't sick, like you'd see an ER treat a drug seeker. Believe me, if I weren't sick I wouldn't have sat in a waiting room for 2 hours (and been willing to pay since my deductible had not been met). It's really not my idea of fun.

By the next day, I was super sick, as expected. They did call to check on me but just said, ""if you aren't better in 7 days come back."" Umm, no thanks.

There was only one staff member that I encountered while in the office who was friendly.

Post visit - I never received a bill; however, I received an email from a biller asking me to pay the balance ASAP or I would go to collections. Wow. On the first attempt to collect a payment, they threatened me with collections?! 

NEVER AGAIN."
293,"The office staff has no joy for their job.  All of the staff aside from the dentist and hygienist, border on rudeness.  
We've been to three different locations.  
My husband had a broken tooth and was in an extreme amount of pain.  They couldn't get him in for a week to see the a different dentist. They called to confirm his appointment for a ""consultation.""  That is not what the appointment was made for.  Then the nerve of the lady to say ""you don't remember what I told you?""  Lady, he's in an extreme amount of pain, if you had told him he'd have to wait a week for a consultation, we would have gone elsewhere.  When he told her that, she hung up on him.  
They called back a short time later and apologized.  I'm sitting at the appointment now listening to a patient bitch that they had the wrong tooth scheduled for a root canal. 
Do not come here, there are tons of other dentist in town.  
We initially went here for convenience.  Never again."
294,"After a brutal day in the ER (7+ hrs) and many tests (even though I explained where my general pain was) it turned out my IUD migrated elsewhere which had given me so much pain I was sure I'd split in half. It needed to be removed. They called the OB/GYN who was ON CALL and she refused to come in. Therefore, they gave me a prescription for pain medicine and said to make an appointment to get it removed some time this week. Unacceptable in every aspect. If there are complications in the next two days (while they weren't ENTIRELY sure of the pain being directly related to my IUD) there is going to be some serious issues. Never again."
295,"ZERO STARS!!! Do NOT go to Dr Sheltons office, suite 435. (Primary care physician) The staff is lazy, they do incorrect testing on clients and they NEVER answer their phone. I was incorrectly tested and recieved a $118 bill (which is being corrected.) Ive called numerous times only to have the phone ring and ring during open hours and my husband has been asked to come early and the door was locked. The staff answered the door for a pizza then had the audacity to tell him not to be an asshole?! Never again."
296,"Don't ever go here. This nurse practitioner by the name of Kelly Reyes is garbage and a waste of time. She is very rude too. Her exact words ""I don't know, I just Prescribe medicine.""
She couldn't care less and rushed everything. Never again."
297,"Their  ER is a dirty crowded disgusting place to be.  I had the misfortune to go to the ER unit in a pinch, had no Insurance at the time. They misdiagnosed me and I had to return ""THREE"" times for the same problem, $4800.00 later...I feel like I got taken over the hurdles, A very impersonal setting, many homeless, drug addicts, shooting victims and in a sleazy neighborhood. NEVER again."
298,"I've been to at least a dozen dentists moving place to place, THIS ONE IS THE WORST. They were very rushed upon giving me a crown, ready to start the procedure immediately, I have no insurance and they were very unsympathetic and we're very rude to me because of it...only to go to 2 other dentists that told me I didn't need a crown at all, just a filling. Also told me I had gingivitus..surprise... I dont. I needed 2 xrays, they took 5 because they kept messing up, thanks for the radiation. My other dentists said they were borderline unreadable and very poorly done. Other people were just hanging out in the room chatting and joking with the dentist, very unproffesional. When I asked for my Xrays and said I needed them by a designated time they were very rude and said 'they were busy, we'll see if we can get to it"". Granted, they did, it was a very rude awkward proccess...which sums up the entire experience; Rude and Awkward. Never again...dont even bother with the Groupon cleaning (which I had done months prior and it was bad) pay the extra $40 and go to a real dentist, not a corporate money machine that preys on your fears and takes advantage of you for your money. I feel bad for all the people they've swindled into procedures they didn't need. DO NOT GO HERE."
299,"Instead of repeating Ian P's story, since mine is almost identical, I'm just going to say that his experience (and that of his family and many acquaintances) is just as mine was. I was given unnecessary tests twice by Sneed's office, for medical issues I KNEW I didn't have. Even Quest Lab's customer service rep thought the order was bizarre, and so did his supervisor! And still I was charged almost $350 for these labs when my insurance wouldn't cover them. 

I should also mention that after living in Austin almost 20 years, I've heard many similar stories about Sneed from friends, as well as someone who used to work for him and quit 2 months later due to all the ""shady business"" going on there. Ask around. By now, almost everyone in town is wise to this quack. Most of us learned the hard way. 

I only went there because Dr. Oubre was so amazing. Now that he's gone, never again."
300,Never again.... I waited an hour and half to see a doctor only to waste $25 for a rude and inconsiderate doctor to tell me he can't help me. I have never been treated so poorly in a healthcare facility.
301,"Receptionists seem to think patients don't see when they roll their eyes or hear their rudeness on the phone when you're waiting for your appointment.  I've been here twice and won't ever go back.  Dr. Curry couldn't get in and out of my appointment fast enough - why wear a gown when she doesn't even look at you?  I left there feeling as if I had just stepped off an amusement ride.  

And don't call them with an urgent matter that would take 5 minutes to complete if they are having their Christmas party the same day.

Never again."
302,"I don't usually get sick, but I did a few weeks ago and turned to the HEB RediClinic.  The initial visit was pretty decent, although a pretty long check-in process.  Once I saw the NP, I got tested for Flu, Strep, Mono, etc.  All negative, but she said based on my symptoms she would treat for strep and send culture away for more specific testing.

I was started on antibiotics and told I would be contacted to stop taking them if the Strep test cam back negative.  A couple days passed and I hadn't heard anything so I called to check.  I didn't want to keep taking antibiotics if I didn't need them.  I got voicemail and left a detailed message.  No return call.

Another two hays passed and I'm halfway though my antibiotics.  Nothing, so I called and left a second voicemail asking for me results.  Once again, no callback.  To this day I still don't know if I needed to take 10 days worth of antibiotic.  I stopped by the clinic while shopping to check, and they actually said they would have to check record and they would call me.  Nothing...  

Never again."
303,"This was my most recent appointment.  Every time I go to this dentist I tell myself never again. Against my better judgment( and necessity)  I went in for a filling it was the worst experience I've had in my life. I am very tough, I love teeth cleanings,  I love going to the dentist. Today I felt like I was tag teamed by a couple of psychopaths. The dentist got into a disagreement with her assistant who must have been a new dental assistant. Her handling of tools and suction was poor, spraying all over my face and air under my lips. They expressed very little concern about covid 19. It seems they were hardly covered. The hygienist who does teeth cleanings covered up better. The novocaine didn't  take, then I had to listen to the dentist chastise the assistant on protocol and knowing what she was using and where to keep it. After a third needle of novocaine, my mouth completely numb, there came to the point where I couldn't bite down to test the bite without biting my inner cheek, the dentist barked at me to ""OPEN!"" when I could barely get my mouth shut to avoid biting on the inside of my mouth.
 She kept saying you're almost done. I told her at one point to take her time because she was rushing so quickly. I stopped her at least once to have suction and a second for the novocaine, because she was hitting a nerve. She leaned on her hands on my lips she jammed instruments into the sides of my mouth and was over all working like a plumber tossing instruments where ever. I have never experienced a rougher dentist in my life.
The appearance of the work is subpar. I can always see margins and today an adjacent tooth looked like it was nicked. She told me the tooth may not make it and may need a root canal. Root canals hurt LESS. It will fail, mark my words.   DO NOT GO TO THIS DENTIST.  If you are at the mercy of public healthcare especially.  I was almost sure she was attempting to actually hurt me. My mouth is sore, raw and hurts to chew, the teeth are super sensitive to temperature and sweetness. Have I missed anything, maybe...but you get the picture."
304,"Question everything here. They are money hungry sales people that make up fraudulent things wrong with your tooth so they can get paid to fix it. Her husband makes crowns, so even if you just need a filling she will force a crown or root canal on you just to get paid. This is a fact. 

After getting my ""allegedly"" needed crown, paying $600 for it, I lived in pain for a week and was blown off by her staff. The crown broke less than a year later, and she charges another $100 to fix it - every other dentist offers a 5 year warranty. Not money hungry Dr. K! I paid for it and then after calling and canceling all my other appointments with this fraud, has the nerve to send a bill for $50 for a missed appointment fee. Never again. Learn how to do business Dr. K and take care of your customers."
305,"Sorry to give one star, but I can't go any lower. 

I've heard there is a doctor/owner of the clinic, but I never saw her. The business plan is that physicians assistants take care of the patients with oversight from Dr. Cynthia Guelic who was rarely seen- that was told to me by a PA who ended up leaving. 

The billing/reception/appointment experience was awful. My insurance said they'd never seen such a messed up bill and rejected payment due to incorrect coding. A year later, I was still battling with them to correct it when they sent me to collections for non payment. I could not get any one to return my call. I complained to the PA who treated me and she told me she was leaving the clinic due to this type of thing. Two years later it was resolved when I went into the office and refused to leave until they fixed it.

The care: the PA was willing to give me anything to deal with depression up to and including experimental medication which was completely wrong for me; however, I wouldn't get drops for pinkeye from another PA, who smugly told me it was probably viral and they don't like to overuse antibiotics. While I think this is a good practice in general, he was wrong. I got care elsewhere.

Never again."
306,Surely there's a better place in Austin to take your kid. Incompetence is the word that kept coming to mind when dealing with these jackalopes. We absolutely HATED our experience there. Never again.
307,"I had PRK surgery and now I can see pretty clearly. I still have a slight prescription and I need to wear glasses while driving. I plan on getting an enhancement surgery. The fact that I can mostly see without glasses is why this place is getting some stars from me. They gave me a good result.

But to be blunt, they suck.

They don't have any idea what patient care is. I went in for so many follow up appointments, and the doctor was trying to convince me that my eyesight would keep improving. I know you need to give PRK a full 6 months, but it stopped improving after less than that and my eyes are in my skull, on my body. I knew they weren't going to improve. When we are at almost 6 months, he still tried to convince me that I'd get there after months of no improvement. Just because his (fake) peppy attitude is what we pay for I guess. Once he finally admitted that my eyesight is as good as it's gonna get, he tried to tell me that my eyesight deteriorated a little bit... NOT TRUE. I know how well I can see.. I have been wearing glasses and contacts for over 25 years. I understand blurry vision. Please don't try to tell me how well I see/don't see. I'm trying to se up my pre-enhancement surgery appointments and they are giving me grief about not having a regular eye exam yet. I didn't know I would need one at this point because THEY NEVER TOLD ME. Horrible customer service. I am only planning to go back there because I don't have to pay for an enhancement surgery. Once I'm done with that and the follow up care, NEVER AGAIN. I will NOT recommend them to anybody else. There has to be better places to get LASIK and PRK done. Places that actually understand patient care. Patience care is necessary even for outpatient visits! This I know, since I work for the top hospitals in Boston."
308,"Nope, never again............went on a Sunday and the guy had no clue as to what was going on with me.  Next time I'll seriously wait for my doctor to open on Monday.  Thanks but no thanks."
309,"So overpriced. I paid $450 for one filling, and no X-rays. They told me I needed four more fillings done because I had cavities. I went to a different dentist for a second opinion. Come to find out, I didn't have any cavities just groovy teeth. Never again..."
310,"I also had a negative experience with Dr. Plunkett regarding my eyesight getting worse at the age of 45. He was dismissive, curt and anything but helpful. Never again."
311,"I had my first visit to Hill Country OB GYN, Seton location, today and I couldn't be happier with them. The receptionist (I'm sorry for not catching your name!) was such a delight to chat with, and she even called my insurance to ask a few questions for me - most places wouldn't bother to do that for a patient. The nurse was a sweetheart, and Dr. Schneider was absolutely amazing! She made me feel comfortable and answered all of my questions. I'm so glad I found this place. Thank you all for your great care! :)

Editing this review because I was charged an obscene amount of money for a total of 6 tests that the doctor did not telling me she was going to run. She told me about one test - I then got a bill for over $1000 with 6 tests on it. Never again."
312,"I had been in scheduling hell trying to get in to see a Dentist here (scheduled two months out) when I came in with a dental emergency. I was literally standing at their desk begging them to see me two weeks early, CRYING and in severe pain... and all I was told was that I would have to wait till 1:00 pm and all they could promise was xrays. I was in such severe pain that I couldn't believe they were turn me away when it was clearly obvious I needed immediate assistance. 
Never again. NEVER will I ever use this place. This is the place just north of Vancouver...Hazel Dell. Seriously a place for low life scum to work and visit so they can practice their third world dentistry. I wouldn't let this place work on my DOG'S teeth! 
I called another dentist ON THE SPOT and got in immediately! 
Screw this place. They flat out suck! The staff is rude and condescending and wouldn't know a dental emergency if one smacked them upside their little illegal heads."
313,Don't go there unless you are ready to get screwed.  They charged my insurance an arm and a leg and then charged me an additional $620.00.  This is total BS.  Do some price shopping.  Go to another city if you need to.  You will still come out ahead.  No wonder they were so nice.  They were laughing under their breath.  Never again.
314,"Well, after my last scathing review, you'd think I'd stop going to Carus in West Lake.  Nope..we kept going because someone from the Georgetown office read my review, stepped in, and corrected the issue with billing/insurance.  It was quickly fixed once the person from Georgetown helped.  Fast forward to four years later and I'm in the exact same situation with this place!!  I had a great and very detail oriented hygienist and she left.  AND!!  Carus keeps sending me bills for over $500 for standard, normal cleanings that ARE COVERED WITH MY INSURANCE.  I have called and left messages for someone to call me to discuss the bill/insurance AND NO ONE HAS CALLED ME BACK.  It's been months and months and months of this crap. They just can't seem to figure out simple insurance claims...still...ever!  It's the last straw.  This time I am REALLY seeking a new family dentist and I will not pay $500 for regular cleanings that are COVERED BY INSURANCE.   grrr!!!!  Never again..for real, this time!"
315,"Never again will I go to this office. After an initial conversation with a receptionist over the phone that was beyond snotty.Never again. 

After a hour plus wait to see a doctor. (I had an appointment) Never again. 

This place is big business with more rooms then doctors. They usher people into rooms to wait. They keep the seats warm in the waiting rooms and care rooms. The speed at which they move would make any person wish they had went to dmv for the day or maybe a emergency room at peak hours.

Horrible experience. Never again."
316,"I really wish I had read these reviews before wasting my time at this place.  One star seems like too much for  the experience.  The check in was fine, the girl was very friendly and also the girl who took my vitals.  The doctor, he wouldn't listen to me,  I don't think 30 seconds passed before he was out of the room.  He said I had an abrasion on my ear that was infected but he gave me no antibiotics, just a cream.  The nurse came in and commented on my ear piercings with a tone that made me uncomfortable, as if I had done something wrong.  Never again."
317,"I went to the clinic with a sharp pain in my left eye.  After taking an extensive history, the young attendant, indicated they don't treat eye problems.  She did a rapid conjunctivitis test for $25, which I was willing to pay for....but the history part was $129....ARE YOU KIDDING ME!!!  Never again."
318,"I checked in on Feb 24th to the ER at 3am due to severe stomach pain. I have a high pain tolerance and this was the second time I've ever been to an ER. I let them know my reason for being there and let them know I didn't drive myself because of the pain.
They checked me in and told me to wait until they had beds available.
I waited 2 hours before I finally got up and checked myself out and let the pain ride itself out and went to see my primary Dr.
While I was in the waiting room there was a homeless man sleeping in the waiting room, I am assuming because it was snowing and cold outside.
It was very dirty and there was a lady in a wheelchair screaming in pain for 40 minutes but they never helped her due to ""not having any beds available.""
I will never ever go to this ER again.
I've had all 4 of my children at this hospital and while the maternity and childbirth departments are amazing, the ER is the worst I've ever been to.

While I was checking myself out, a little boy came in with his dad and he was literally barking due to croup cough. We all paused as soon as we heard him because it was that bad. 
They put a band on his wrist and sent him to the waiting room as well!
That's ridiculous. Never again."
319,"This was my third visit to this location my first visited resulted in a slight misdiagnosis my second visit was to acknowledge the miraculous recovery and I was informed I didn't need a double cornea replacement, yes I was relieved, puzzled and confused since I've always been very fortunate to have healthy eyes and although I was a little freaked out at the time I  just wrote it off since I knew I would never accept a ridiculous diagnosis without getting multiple follow ups from other specialist. My follow up was successful and I went about my business dismissing the incident.

When I planned this appointment it was without hesitation, I booked it online and it seemed easy peasy just as it was for my initial visit. This location is about an hour from my home but getting a weekend appointment made it well worth it and since my prior appointment ended well I felt okay about returning, actually since I was a returning customer I figured I'd be in and out without issue (I'm pretty sure my file is filled with some very interesting notes).

Upon arrival I was greeted at the counter at the front of the store and directed to the receptionist in the rear - after not being acknowledged there I grabbed a seat while listening to her personal phone conversation and watched as she dismissed herself. We did connect upon her return and after presenting my insurance information to her she quickly dismissed it stating they don't accept my carrier - then told me I could keep my appointment if I wanted to pay out of pocket. I calmly informed her I confirmed my insurance with LensCrafters prior to confirming my appointment and she reply ""I understand that and if you don't want to pay out of pocket she understood"" and then told me they don't use the information I provided online. It's no surprise this place gets the negative feedback it does - never again..."
320,"I haven't been the happiest with these guys. I pay my deposit, order my order and then...nothing. I pay my bill for $350 and still nothing. Finally, I call them back and they tell me that they er...misplaced my order. Wth? 

The only reason that they still get three stars from me is that they were really nice and apologetic, and I've paid, so of course, I have a follow up appointment. But I can't say that I'd recommend them in a hurry. 

The guys who fit you seem quite professional on the outset, but losing your order isn't very cool. And the people at the front don't seem to have any idea what you're talking about when you ask. I don't get it.

Still, the place seems busy enough, but now that I've done my research, I'm hoping that there is some better competition out there. I also hope that if you're reading this, you have no idea what I'm talking about since your feet are in top condition. 

A note to the ladies: don't continue to wear high, beautiful or pointy shoes, especially those that look great but are just a ""bit"" too tight, yes, even the ones that you fought someone over to purchase. Never again. And now, they want me to dress like Geppetto. Great."
321,"First of all, the location is awesome. Very nice building, complimentary valet. 
Second of all, the staff (admin and nurses) were all nice and understanding. 

However, I am entirely unimpressed with the doctor I saw. I spoke to Dr. Konsens for about five or six minutes. This is of course after they have taken X-rays of my knee-- which I had already done at centra care and been told my bones were fine. That was a great time waster. So he tells me my bones are fine (shocker?) and prescribes an anti inflammatory, gives me some stretches and sends me on my way. Tells me to come back in 3-4weeks and then maybe we'll get an MRI if I'm not better. 

I was beyond upset because I'm in pain and I'm in school for massage therapy- I have to use my knee! I have to know what's wrong before I screw it up even more. I don't have four weeks. But Dr Konsens didn't address that at all- nor did he care. I'm going to do research and find a doctor in Orlando/Winter Park that actually cares. I wholly regret taking time off work to go to Jewett. Never again."
322,"Sadly after getting lip augmentation I was shocked on the price increase since I travel and used to love to come and have several things done ; this was the second time I questioned a price increase . But not only have they changed quite a bit they cant seem to keep staff. High turn over rate here. People that used to work here try to encourage me to go elsewhere but i remained loyal. But what happened to me was inexcusable not only did  the front desk new receptionist ignore me when l questioned the high bill for the same filler that was used the last time, but she was rude and was strangely avoiding me. After the fact she gets the office manager wife of Dr. Hall, who continues to berate me over the fact I got discounts but failing to tell me before hand there was a price increase. It was like SURPRISE --  the second time this happened here. Embarrassing was the word! And her indiscretion and telling me off in front of several people was to shut me up and her cruel smile made obvious that she felt she won the augument. How could anyone come to place that would purposely embarrass their clientele and expect them to return blaming you, not them. Sadly a woman who happened to be a witness at Halls ran into me at the grocery store  came up to me and told me I was in the right by her failure to inform me of the price increase. So For this reason be warned before any procedures -- ask for the price in writing. This is not Bevery Hills where they bill you without giving you a price  -- been there done that. Never again!  Plain greed, UPDATE .................After this review was posted TIsha Hall called my private residence SEVERAL times  and confronted me at HEB when I went grocery shopping yesterday upset about the review I wrote; her harassment is getting  concerning I  am planning to report her to the BBB and law enforcement if she continues to stalk and berate me. She has real anger issues. Still shocked by the behavior. I say never again."
323,"These events took place 9/16/20
This Sanford Advent Health Centra care is the worst medical facility I've ever been to.   Starting  with the appointment time.  We were set for 5p, got there 445p and did not get seen until 630pm we were out of there by 645 pm.   Two hours for a 15 minute appointment.  
 But that is not the worst of it.   They were supposed to send the prescription to Publix.  It took us about 25 minutes to get to Publix and they still ( @715pm ) had not received the prescription.   I called Centra care and asked what was the delay.  The lady on the phone said it was sent and I should wait a little.    I waited 30 minutes went back  into Publix and they still had not received anything.   At this point I asked the pharmacist to call Centra care as it was obvious There was a communication problem.  At the same time I also called Centra care and advised them that the pharmacy was closing at 9pm and that my wife was in pain and needed the medication.  I was rather firm with the lady, so according to her she personally talked to the pharmacist and said that the prescription was now on the way.  So we waited another 25 minutes.  The pharmacist said that now she got it but it would be 15 minutes to fill it. So we waited more.  Now the pharmacist called us and said "" you have 3 prescriptions any questions ? "".  I said we were only supposed to get 2 for back pain.  Some how the Doctor/ nurse that talked to the pharmacist gave her prescriptions for a upper respiratory infection including a Zpack.   Now this is EXTREMELY DANGEROUS.  If we're were not paying attention we would've taken the wrong meds home.   The worst is that a Advent Health Centra Care doctor had to verbally give this prescription to the pharmacist as their system to send the prescription information was not working correctly. 
Some how he or she got it all wrong.   
So the Publix pharmacist had to call again and ask for another verbal prescription, this time the correct one as she now had my prescription list given to me by Centra care.  The same place that got it all wrong.  It's now 9 pm and we just got home.  
What the hell are you guys doing over there ? What a disorganized unprofessional  clinic.  How can you call your selves a medical clinic ? You are more like a 7 eleven  and that's an insult to 7 eleven because at least at 7 eleven you will get your order fast and correctly.   By the way this is the second time this happens.  Incredible.  Never again."
324,"This is a review for the full body massage I received and not for their feet massage service. 
Just not a fan of this place. My masseuse did not seem very knowledgeable and did not say a single word to me the entire time. They should be communicating what to expect and ask what areas they should concentrate on. My hair was pulled and my skin was pinched. She would accidentally go over my bones instead of the tendons and muscles which is super painful! 

I am a regular at massage heights and they are trained professionals that actually care for your health/improvement. I will stick with them.

One full hour of disappointment. The girls that work in the front aren't very pleasant either. Lacking in many ways. They get one star for ambiance but mostly because it's the only way I can review. You get what you pay for--cheap prices for poor service.

**Update**
I now am noticing bruises along my arms. Never again."
325,"Absolutely the worse clinic. They crookedly nickel and dime you. Ask questions in advance in regards to insurance and misc charges.  I went in for allergies/cold symptoms and was told that the doc may want to do a flu test but that would be determined after I met w her.  Test was ordered before I got the chance to speak to her and was later told it was going to be $23. Ok. Thought she was being cautious. After speaking to the medical assistant who took my stats, a second ""student from UT"" came in and so I repeated my story/symptoms. Finally after 2 hours, a nurse practitioner came in, not a doctor, asking what my symptoms were. Are you kidding me.. I had to repeat my symptoms three times! She was there all of two minutes and asks the med assistant if the flu shot was ordered and med assnt said yes. It was very clear the flu test was ordered automatically not after consultation. Lastly, she says I need a steroid shot and antibiotics. I'm exhausted and ready for bed and clearly annoyed by the service. Waited in the room another 30 minutes for flu test results to come back which were negative. Assistant finally comes in and gives me a steroid shot w a syringe needle that was too small for the liquid to come out. Several pokes on the ass and another 20 minutes later, I am finally released. I check out, on top of my copay, I pay for the flushot $23, then the steroid shot $9 and an admin fee of $22 which covers the fee paid to the assnt who gave me the shot. All in all my office visit including copay almost equaled $100!! Mind you I have excellent insurance. Why pay for coverage if you're paying out of pocket for high and possibly unnecessary fees. Never happened with any other doctor's office where you actually see a ""DOCTOR"".  So after all that, I go to the pharmacy downstairs to pay for my medicine but it was never called in! Nurse practitioner had already left so I had to wait an additional 30 minutes for my prescription.

Oh and by the way, if you go for any annual preventative check ups which are normally covered 100% by your insurance and positive results come back, be prepared to come back and pay for another consultation visit and copay so that they can go over the results with you. 

NEVER AGAIN. Nope."
326,"My husband and I both decided to have this treat. My husband has studied reflexology and knows meridians, I do not, unless you count what I've learned via osmosis. 

First impression was it was warm and stuffy. The licenses are posted. There are a plethora of therapists, but you don't choose, you are assigned. My husband's therapist wore a mask. The interesting thing was she only covered her mouth and chin. If she was trying to avoid fumes, she didn't.  If she was trying not to exhale into the atmosphere,  she didn't. Why wear the mask? Methinks to hide identity for licensure reasons, but I cannot prove it. There were a handful wearing masks just that way.

Time to get on with what happened. We were less into a pitch black room. We stumbled back and were told to take a seat. My 69 year old husband who uses a cane and walks stooped over attempted to sit on an ottoman and a table before he was assisted into a chair that was one over from where he started. I groped my way into a chair and sat. 

The therapists came out assisted my with raising my pants legs up to  knees and then placed my feet into tepid, not warm, water. The therapist said something to me that I could not understand. I understood my husband's therapist though.  It was water or hot tea. I chose hot tea. As I sipped my hot tea, the therapist began the choreographed reflexology session. I say choreographed as I began to notice the couple's whose session began a few minutes before ours. Then I watched my husband's therapist, she was doing EXACTLY what my therapist was doing. It could be an Olympic event. 

You're wondering how I'm able to watch anything in the darkness. My husband asked them to adjust the lights. They did adjust them. It gradually got brighter. I don't know if they continued to adjust them or not, but it was much brighter by the time we left.

I was amazed. I was trying to relax, but reflexology, no. My husband asked his therapist is she could forego some areas and concentrate on some of his problem areas on his foot. She got up and had to speak with the manager. After a conversation in an Asian language, she did so and the synchronization stopped. I was able to keep up with my neighbors though, so I wasn't surprised with what came next.

After they finished with my feet, you are expected to spin around in this chair and lay back for a brief temporal and shoulder massage. This consists of light massage only. 

When the session was over, the therapists hovered at the counter until I told them that I included their tips on the card and then they scattered. 

I saw several issues including they never asked if I had any trouble spot or if I was a diabetic. Feet to a diabetic are very important and need to be handled with care. Another concern and a huge one (The reason I will NEVER step foot no pun intended in there again) is that I watched them clean between clients. My husband is a microbiologist. I would hate to culture this place. They have rolled up towels that they used to support client's necks as they sit in the chairs. Then these same towels are used over the ottoman when you flip around and lay your head on it. After these clients left, the therapist simply refilled the towel and placed it back on the chair for the next client to use. It doesn't cost that much to wash towels. It does cost to have that many towels. 

I went home and scrubbed my hair. Never again."
327,"If it was possible to give a zero or negative rating, I would.  I went to them only due to being an approved provider per my insurance plan.  Never again.

I waited for more than an hour past my scheduled appointment time to even be seen for the pre-screening before my eye exam on 8/4/18.  Then, I was told my glasses would be ready within two weeks.  On 8/18, I heard nothing, so I called on 8/20, only to be told the glasses weren't there, and they had not yet finished checking in that day's order, but that they did ship from the lab on 8/16, so it could be any time.  The following day, I called back, speaking to Sonya.  She informed me they never got their 8/16 shipped orders, and that she would follow up with store support and I should call again the next day.  The next day, when I called, she asked if I wanted her to resubmit my order, to which I applied in the affirmative.  That was 8/22.

That brings me to yesterday (9/5).  I called to check the status of my reorder, speaking to Danielle.  She was unable to tell me anything but took my number and told me someone would call back in a few minutes.

Around 1 pm today, having still heard nothing back from my call the prior day, I called the corporate office to discuss further what happened.  That was a joke.  I was on hold for a while before the woman who was ""helping"" me (I use that term both loosely and sarcastically) informed me that the reorder was just placed yesterday.  Immediately upon learning this, and that my order was being rushed by the lab, I told them to cancel the order and demanded a refund of the $201.80 they took from my HSA spending card and was told I had to contact the store for that.  After the level of ""service"" I'd already received, I told the corporate office I'd prefer to get the refund via my attorney.  I opted, instead, to contact my HSA and their bank to dispute the charge (form will be to them tomorrow).  Eventually, I called the store to speak to Sonya, giving a chance to confess her error and oversight.  I again spoke to Danielle, who put me on hold when I asked to speak to Sonya.  She picked up again after a few minutes, having forgotten what I wanted, and once I told her, she then told me Sonya was on break.  Seriously?  Incompetence is on display here, and I would advise anyone thinking of using them to go elsewhere.

9/12/18 - Update
I received a call today to inform me my glasses were in.  I missed said call, but, on my return call, the person to whom I was speaking commented that I sounded angry (well, yeah).  I explained my prior call, and that I'd told Danielle to pass on to Sonya that I was canceling my order, that they lost my business, and that I was disputing the charge on my card.  They can't even get a cancellation right."
328,"(1) They don't take credit cards (unlike just about every other doctor's office).

(2) When we made our appointment and told them we'd be paying out of pocket, they didn't *warn* us that they don't take credit cards, which led to the following debacle:

(3) When M. took our kids in for their appointment, the staff wouldn't let them see the doctor because of payment concerns, even though M. had $140 in cash on her (and even though it was their fault for not warning us that they don't take credit cards).  They apparently would have seen us only if we walked in with several hundred or thousands of dollars of cash (and they certainly didn't warn us of that unusual requirement when we made the appointment).

(4) M. called me so I could talk to the staff, and I told them I was across town, but that when I was finished I could come in and pay any difference in cash.  They agreed.  Then as soon as they got off the phone they changed their mind, and sent M. and the kids home to wait for another appointment.  This needlessly wasted our time.

The only reason we went back again was because this doctor could see us faster than others.  The kicker was that when we went back, they didn't even charge us for the visit, as all we needed was a letter for the school saying that a certain vaccine was contraindicated based on a past reaction, and the nurse who saw us didn't think that was chargeable.  Yet the first time we visited, $140 and a platinum credit card wasn't enough for them, despite their own failure to warn us they didn't take credit cards.  Four strikes and you're out.  Never again.

UPDATE:  In Dr. McMains' reply below, he appears to think that the only problem I encountered was that the practice didn't accept credit cards.  His cluelessness about the bad experience his staff foisted on us (even after I painstakingly enumerated the individual issues) only confirms that we made the right choice to go elsewhere for our healthcare."
329,"Dr. B is the most wonderful chiropractor there is! I wish I still lived in Atlanta because I miss him on a weekly basis. The staff is ALWAYS friendly and the wait is never long. I love that they give you a few minutes on a chair or roller bed and then a few minutes with the electro therapy unit to loosen you up before the crack! 

Dr. B helped relieve me of so much pain without pressure to be in his office all the time. He completely understood my financial burdens and was welcoming me with all smiles whenever I could make it in. As he was working on me, he asked if I get headaches a lot. I said yes, but that I didn't think it was due to the back pain, but my sinuses. Dr. B worked miracle magic by ""popping my sinuses"" (sounds painful but there's no actual cracking of the face) and I went from having the worst sinus headaches twice a week to NEVER AGAIN. This was two years ago, guys. 

Dr. B is a miracle worker and really listens to your needs. I also have to highly recommend his masseuse on staff, Caroline (lyn). If you are in need of a deep tissue massage, she is the best in Atlanta. She gives the right amount of pressure and you can literally feel the difference in tension when she is done with the first side of your body. 

His whole staff is wonderful and I hope when I move back to Atlanta he is still practicing!

DON'T HESITATE TO GO HERE, HE IS AMAZING!"
330,"SCAM ARTISTS...  Don't go here.  They will nickel and dime you.  $167 for an office visit!!  They insisted on getting a blood test from my husband when he knew all he had was sinus infection.  He's in his mid-40's, he's had many sinus infections, never before has a physician basically forced a blood test  for a sinus infection.

Aside from the fact that the office manager was not on the premises and the physician who worked with my husband was incredibly unfriendly.

And he waited 2 1/2 hours to no avail.  Walked out with no antibiotics...  

Also, they misdiagnosed me years ago.  I actually had pneumonia and they treated me for bronchitis.  They later called me and apologized after I sought better medical attention.

NEVER AGAIN."
331,"Sitting in the er for almost three hours. Without a single update. We've done this a lot over the last several years so it's not like we are rookies at it but we came to OSU at our Dr.'s request instead of Riverside. Never again. 

This place is a literal and figurative mess. They are moving one person about every 30-45 minutes. The staff is clearly stressed and very rude. Normally I'm quick to cut folks In this situation a break, but this may be the worst I've ever seen in recent memory.

Any questions are met with a quick rebuke for bothering the staff and the best they can do is stand at one end of the er waiting area and scream people's names: it's 2011 and the best they can do to communicate is scream names?

Part Deux (12 hours later)
Once we got in to see a physician it was the exact opposite. Attentive and great care with a team that was very much focused on taking care of business."
332,I took my sister last Friday as told by UT phone nurses and was told she only pulled a muscle by a doctor there. Turns out she has a kidney infection. The doctor that diagnosed her with the infection said the one who saw her Friday here should've noticed ALL the symptoms. Good thing she was forced to go again to another doctor today to get a CORRECT diagnosis. Never again.
333,"I've been to ER once here and I am never going back. Besides the receptionist and the guy who gave me my EKG, everyone was very rude and dismissive. As an OSU student myself, I must say I expected better. 

I went in due to arrhythmia, tachycardia and excruciating chest pain. At first sight I am too young to have a heart attack, but at the time I was suffering from bulimia and had been vomiting heavily for the past 48 hours. I was so sick that I couldn't keep down water. 

Dr. Delatore was my physician and he did not take me seriously at all. At one point he asked me ""what made you think that this was a good reason to come to the ER?"" I'll add that it was a Sunday afternoon so they weren't exactly swamped--even so, I waited so long to go in that my tachycardia (which had lasted for two hours previously) had stopped. I told him that I couldn't keep down water and that I was so dehydrated that my tongue was sticking to my teeth but he didn't do anything for me and rolled his eyes when I told him I had suffered from an eating disorder for sixteen years. A nurse was nice enough to bring me ice chips but I asked for a blanket three times and never got one even though I was shaking and my extremities were turning blue/purple. 

I always see these OSU med center ads on Facebook that say ""there's no such thing as a normal irregular heartbeat"" but warning: if your heart is acting up they'll treat you like an idiot or a hypochondriac unless you're in full-on cardiac arrest, at which point I'm sure they'll ask why you didn't come in earlier. Never again."
334,"The staff was very nice and professional.. The ""doctor"" on the other hand was horrible. She started off with ""Why are you here?!""  I had no idea who she even was. (the only reason I know now is because of the paperwork I was given at the end). The assistant  was even a bit shocked by the attitude. I did not hear her the  first time. Then she said again ""Why are you here?"" So I told her.. At which point she looked in my ears from a distance and told me to say ""AHHH"" which I did, never really showing any interest in me or asking me anything more. At that moment she turned around and walked off just saying ""sinusitis"". That was it... nothing else. The tech at that moment just stared at her and just said. ""OKkkkkk"" he was even in shock about the way she just treated me.... I got a whole whopping 2 mins with a ""doctor"" if even that. But I did watch her treat other patients with children fantastic. She was even chatting the parents up and talking to the children, even showing photos. Will I go back? NO NEVER AGAIN. On top of that they charged my insurance over $200.00 plus me a co-pay of 50.00. For less than 5 mins of work.... So no way in hell will I spend another penny there. I will rather sit hours in the ER at least there people care and talk to me..."
335,"I was a new patient of Dr. Dawn Hutchinson and had seen her once.  At the beginning of January, I severely injured my lower back and ended up at the ER.  I dutifully scheduled my follow up appointment with Dr. Hutchinson.  The back pain was so intense that I could barely walk, hadn't slept more than an hour at a time, and had found no relief.  Dr. Hutchinson never looked up from her keyboard except to say to me, ""I'm not  giving you pain medication.""  As I began sobbing from fear of enduring this pain longer, she handed me a referral for physical therapy and left the  room.  She never comforted nor tried to help me, and showed no compassion.  NONE.  I was in my most vulnerable state coming to my doctor for help and was treated like garbage.  To drive the final nail in my coffin, the notes about my visit that she so furiously typed while I was convulsing in pain are COMPLETELY INACCURATE and paint me in a terrible light.  These are the people we trust with our care?  NEVER AGAIN.  I cannot make my warning strong enough:  do not consider Dawn Hutchinson as your doctor."
336,Going to a doctor is bad enough. Going to a urologist is even worse. Having all my personal data stolen on top is adding insult to injury. I never dreamed in a million years that our personal information was being stored in some insecure database. I got a letter stating that all my personal information was hacked from their system. I haven't gotten a single follow-up notice: is someone investigating the hack? Has my identity been stolen? Never again.
337,"I would not recommend Dr. Varner or this practice to anyone. I initially saw her after my husband suggested PCPATL as he visits Dr. Samuel Adams, and was not too impressed. Her Office staff /assistant was very very very rude and does not care about the patients and acted like they hated working there and doing their job. They would not return the call untill they receive few voice mails on the same issue.

I had an appointment for a physical with Dr. Varner for my first visit. After having blood work done, I had to wait for about 10 days to get a call informing the results. They would not do a postal mail of the blood work results to you unless you send a self addressed postage paid envelope to her. Either they will tell you the numbers or fax it to you .... but sorry.... no mailing....They care more about their 44 cents postal fee.

People would be nuts to go this doctor.. NEVER AGAIN..."
338,"DO NOT GO HERE!

I thought I had lucked out when this place was listed in my network and saw the fantastic reviews. Boy was I wrong. This place is only in business to make money at whatever cost possible. They do not care about their patients. 

I made my first appointment over the phone and was excited to finally get some relief from my allergies. I had never undergone allergy testing and was looking forward to getting this done and finding something that worked better than the over the counter medicine I had been taking. At my first appointment I was told I had to be off my over the counter medicine for a week before I could get the testing done, something that could've been said over the phone so I wouldn't have to come back again the next week and pay a second co-pay. Strike one. 

Once Dr. Gaglani tried to talk me into getting the allergy shots and told me that my insurance plan was very good and that I should take advantage. I was told it would cover 80% of the costs. I told her I would think about it and stuck to a prescription. My prescription was sent to the wrong pharmacy. Strike two.

I went back for my one month checkup to see how my prescription had worked out and asked for more info on the allergy shots. I was convinced it would be a good deal and decided to go for it. I show up for my first shot and the nurse asks me if I brought my epi-pen. I was told I would get one but was not told when or where. Apparently they sent a prescription to my pharmacy without telling me I needed to bring this with me to the first visit. Strike three. 

A few days after my first shot, I get a bill emailed to me for the full cost of the allergy shots because my insurance does not cover it. After I was told NUMEROUS times that it did. Needless to say I will not be going back to this place. Maybe it's just my ignorance to the way the health system works, apart from seasonal allergies I'm very healthy so I don't have much experience with this. But this is just a terrible way to run an office. The disorganization, the inconvenience, the lack of truthful information is all too much. Never again."
339,"My appointment was scheduled with Dr. Hicks-Graham at 2:15p and she finally came in to see me at 3:15p. However, I guess that is pretty common for any doctor's visit. I was there to discuss dark marks with her and she did not fully address my concerns. When I was ready to ask her another question, I noticed that she had already left and her assistant tried her best to answer my questions. She stayed in the room for 10 minutes. She showed no empathy and did not understand how frustrating it is for me to deal with the skin disorder that I had been dealing with. Never again."
340,"I went in for their 2 pairs for cheap special. Everyone was helpful and courteous. 

Positives: 
* The place is clean.
* They were efficient. 
* Helpful with info about frame and lens types. 
* Did not try to hard sell me on garbage. 
* Doc got me in and measured my eyes quickly. 
* The price was as advertised. 

I would give them five starts except Negatives:

* When the glasses arrived, one pair was perfect and one was so bad it made my eye hurt. I told them so and they said oh just try it for a while and see if you get used to it. I did. And didn't. Get used to it. The one pair is great, the other almost unusable. I went back in. They shuffled with the glasses. Hot sand, lens cleaner,  frame adjustment. -Theory being I'm a liar or idiot and they can just ""polish my complaint away""-. It did not work. 

After pleading with them, they said they would ""send them back and fix it"" what ever that means. Week later, I went back in. Exact same pair of glasses. They never did anything with them. I know because I marked them because I have dealt with budget scrapers like this before. The reason for the 2 stars is the dishonesty. I would have given them 3 because the one pair of glasses is great. But they bulls----ed me about the second pair.

So a quick lesson in economics. When a company makes a deal like this, they will honor it. But if the factory in burma or laos gets it wrong, you are NEVER. EVER. EVER getting it fixed. Short of a lawsuit. Because they made an offer on tight margin and if they fixed their mistakes they would lose money. 

So if you buy in to one of their promos, just know, it's a crap shoot. They will not fix their mistakes. And you will have to suck it up. They are an ok place but they are definitely just the other side of shady on those margins. Just saying.

2 stars. And never again."
341,"Avoid Dr. Benjamin Havemann. He actually says POO instead of bowel movement, BM or defecation. He diagnosis are not written in medical terms but says things like ""all over the map"".  He is rude, condescending, has infantile terminology, has no time to listen, said he knew me from somewhere, screamed LISTEN TO ME, and also said I should get a second opinion. He basically wanted my copay and had only 15 minutes and no time to waste on a Mexican woman with a cyclic bloating issue. Sadly I was referred to this intimidating doctor by ER. I should of known better from his reputation in this area not to go to him. Never again. Please message me if you want the full details."
342,"We followed the ambulance here and went through front lobby. Told receptionist that our son was brought in and to let intake know we were here so we could provide additional info needed. She called back to intake and then told us to wait. We waited for 2 hours only to be told we had to wait until visiting hour to see our son. We weren't provided process information, facility information... nothing. We didn't even know if our son was admitted. When we were coming back for visiting hour I called to ask what we could bring and if our son was okay. They asked for a patient number... which we were never given. Had to fight to get them to go tell our son to call us with his ID number. Saw our son and when leaving was finally handed a ""family handbook""?!?! Next day I called patient advocate to address my concerns. She agreed our situation had been poorly handled and explained that our son was a pretty serious hold, this was a complete shock.... I had to explain to my son that they said he made concerning statements.... upset me, him, etc.... come to find out she had looked at the wrong chart and gave incorrect information!?! My son had to insist on seeing his file and advocate for himself. Their entire process was a nightmare. I can't image how a patient could advocate for themselves if they were in worse shape. After I asked my son to trust the process, I had to fight to get him out because I couldn't trust he wouldn't be mistaken for another patient. He wouldn't take anything but a multivitamin there because he was afraid of what they might give him. And he had to insist on looking at the bottle where the vitiman came from before taking it. They took a scared and upset family and young adult and exponentially made the situation worse. This was our son's first experience and never again."
343,"Went to Vinings area location. Had a terrible experience here.
Our new house is far from my usual ENT, so when it came time for my annual hearing exam, I booked a new patient appt with ENT Institute bc it was closer to my home.
I WILL NEVER RETURN, as I was physically harmed, dismissed, and overcharged. 
When the audiologist saw wax in my ear, he said I'd need it cleaned out before he could do an exam (no mention that wax removal would be an additional cost - more on that later). Anyway, the PA, Alicia Gainey, came in to do the wax removal.
Now, I have had my ears cleaned out several times previously. I'm not new to this rodeo. It's always kind of uncomfortable. But I've NEVER had such a bad experience. For one, the suction tool she used kept making a loud, beeping noise in my ear. I told Gainey it was too loud and was hurting my ear, but my pleas were ignored.
She couldn't get all the wax, so she got a water/hydrogen peroxide solution. Rather than a gentle pour into my ear, it was shot in my ear by some device with such a velocity that I actually screamed out in pain.
""Ouch! That REALLY hurts!"" I said. 
Did Gainey stop? Nope. 
Instead she said, ""It's just air and water"" as if I was being a huge baby, and continued with her painful spray until I was almost crying and demanded she stop.
Even after this, she treated me not like a patient she was hurting, but like a baby who was wasting her time. 
By the time she was done, my left ear - which felt completely normal when I came in - felt painful and ""full"" and I was dizzy/felt I might fall. 
I told both Gainey and the audiologist these things. Both immediately went into a ""cover your own *ss"" routine of ""well, maybe you're congested,"" and ""well maybe you have a cold,"" and ""well maybe it's eustacian tube dysfunction. That CAN happen. Let me put this scope through your nose.""
I told Gainey that 1. I had no dizziness or ear pain & fullness feeling in that ear when I entered the office. 2. She continued to mess with my ear despite me telling her she was hurting me, and that her actions - not my nasal passages - were what made my (again, previously FINE) ear hurt. and 3. There was no way I was going to let her scope me after what she'd just done. 
She then refuses to acknowledge that she was/is the cause of my pain but says she'll RX me a steroid to reduce any potential swelling. When I pointed out that I am already on steroids for an unrelated matter (she obviously hadn't read my file), she advised me to take my current steroids PLUS her steroid RX.
I went to the front desk - ear still hurting/feeling full, and me still dizzy - and asked to file a complaint. I was given a telephone # to call. I called it, and got an answering machine. I left a message that was not returned. 
It's at this point that I receive my bill for their ""services"": $200! 
I was never, at any time in this process, told to expect to pay anything outside of my insurance copay of $50. At no time during my visit was I made aware that any aspect of my exam would be an additional cost. I've also NEVER paid $200 to see my regular ENT...and that includes for annual hearing exams and wax removal.
Never again. I just hope she didn't do permanent damage."
344,"I was referred by ARC to this man, I could not be more dissatisfied.  I had a straight case of plantar fasciitis in my right foot.  I had brought X-rays with me and explained that I had not had any specific trauma.  He gave me a boot brace and told me that he couldn't tell anything from the X-rays and that he would need an MRI before he knew what was going on.  

If you do any research about plantar fasciitis, you know that 95% of the cases are healed by medication and staying off the affected foot.  I was charged $270 through my insurance for him to tell me that he needed an MRI before he could help me.  I did not get the totally unnecessary MRI and my foot healed within 7 days of taking an anti-inflammatory (indomethacin, prescribed by the initial MD).  

I only give him 1 star because he gave me a script for hydrocodone that I desperately needed to alleviate the horrible pain in my foot.  I spent a total of about 4 minutes with the DPM and never felt that I was anything more than someone from whom he could extract money.  The male nurse that helped me there had about as much empathy as a lamp.

Our healthcare system is in the hands of those who are more interested in lining their pockets than actually helping people who are in pain.  Carlos Romero is one such DPM.  Never again."
345,"Avoid Urology Austin if you value your time, your health and your money! You know there's something a little suspicious when they have you pay in advance for their services. Waited over an hour for my 3:15 appointment, which I arrived early for. The first 30 min. I waited in the main waiting area then another 30 min. in an exam room. By 4:15, still no doctor, no word, no nothing. No one even came in to communicate with me what the situation was or why it was taking so long. Went into the hallway to 2nd nurses station and asked where my doctor was.  She said, ""Oh, he's with another patient but you'll be next.""  Waited another 10 min.  Still no doctor, no communication.  Went back into the hallway.  It was a ghost town.  No one around.  Promptly went to checkout desk and asked for a refund (which they provided).  Admin there said, ""Oh yeah, we had a procedure today. Sometimes you just have to expect things to change."" You also know there's something suspicious when the staff immediately blame you instead of taking responsibility for their delay.  Finally, you also know there's something suspicious when there's little to no communication when things DO change.  I was a patient (very briefly) of Dr. John Williamson. Never again.  Enter at your own risk.  Better yet - just go somewhere else."
346,"A complete and utter cluster-f**k. Never again. If your employer requires a drug screen, request a different location. I would have gladly driven 30 miles for a different location."
347,STAY AWAY. Took me an hour for a drug screening. Never again.
348,"If it was possible to give less than a 1 I would. This place is horrible. This place is trash. Customer service is the worse I've ever seen at a spa. We made a reservation for 4 people, paid over the phone with our card and everything. Got there and was told we only made a reservation for 3 people. The lady with reddish hair and glasses and very sloppy ponytail told us we never Alley, etc., etc. We showed her our phone with the call log with date and time and she still acted like we were lying. So she finally finds our reservation but not before properly insulting us by telling us we were lying. I bring my 3 sisters there from Philly and we were really looking forward to this. Also, we had some static that last we went there with my sisters. But I was eager to show my sisters, so I dismissed it. But this time I am not letting it go. Then the masseuse fell asleep while massaging my sisters legs. She said he woke up and then apologized for falling asleep. We told the clerk. Again she accuses us of lying without speaking to the masseuse first. She claimed she didn't speak his language and needed a translator. She agree to cut my sisters price in half after again but she didn't seem happy. The rest of us paid full price. But I will never be back. When you bring family in town, you want them to be treated well. Then, we left our cell phone on the counter. She didn't run out or nothing to say she had our phone. She just let us leave. We came back and we saw she called our number, but she has the phone. Omg! This is so bad. I can't believe it. I had been coming to this place for 6 years. I have to say, I had come here mainly for the price and the experience once in there. But the front desk always seemed mean. Now, I know it's not just my imagination. They treated my sisters the same way twice in one day. Never again. I'll go to the one in Buckhead. Hopefully, their customer service is better."
349,"Everything in this review is my opinion...(I went to the one in Cedar park) This place recommends x-rays before the Dr. even sees the patient.  Nice. I come from a medical family and this is not standard practice unless it's obviously warranted, ummm, it wasn't even close.  

Of course since there is no consultation about any reasoning behind an x-ray or  how much this costs or even see a Dr. before x-rays, you feel a little strapped over a barrel, like you're a bad mom unless you spend an outrageous amount of money for x-rays you don't need.  

I actually brought my daughter in for another issue which they did an okay job with.  However, she fell the day before (very, very mildly swollen wrist and NO bruising). I only mentioned bc we were already there! Never again. Apparently,  the doctor needed multiple x-rays to tell me the obvious.  She hurt her wrist, it's sore.  Duh.  Thanks.  

Don't go here unless you're prepared to walk out with a minimum of a $700 bill. I really hate it when medical professionals soil the name by taking advantage of patients.

 Not to mention:
As a new patient you pay $497 for literally walking in the door.  They conveniently don't mention that as they say ""oh you can pay after services"" hahaha.  I'm sure people would get the #*%#%#% out of there if they knew highway robbery was about to happen. .  And they charged $75 for a Velcro wrist band that you can buy at Walmart for $15.  In my opinion, you have to question the legitimacy of this practice."
350,"I agree with another reviewer...either lazy or could not care less about patients.  Lousy patient interaction.  Felt totally rushed when visiting about a condition I was especially concerned about.  When I scheduled a follow up visit on their on line system and showed up, office staff said ""Oh we don't use that system anymore...""  WTF?!  I said take it off your website and was told ""we've tried.""  Are you kidding me.  Never again."
351,"If I could give 0 stars I would. What sort of comment is ""we aren't a children's hospital"" from a nurse at the desk, like I can't hear her. Sorry you were the closest hospital at the time for the emergency at hand - but NEVER again."
352,Horrible experience. Took my kids there for cleanings.  They both thought it was an exam but turned out to be charged for cleanings.  When I asked about the service they insisted that they did cleanings.  NEVER AGAIN.
353,"What's the point in making an appointment when you are going to check in and sit in the lobby for over an hour.  Nice bnb people, but very alow service. Never again."
354,"I am late with my review but this was the worst experience I ever had at a hospital. I checked in with a kidney infection and the young lady said it would not be long. Only 3 people in the waiting room. After 6 hours and being asked 3 times if I had provided a urine sample(which I had when I checked in) I finally got to leave and go get my prescription! That was NOT treated as an emergency but they sure do charge you for the ""emergency"". NEVER again."
355,"I had to switch dentists after my insurance changed through my work. I visited this office twice and had Dr Carpinito do the cleanings both times himself. (I guess he doesn't have any hygenists?)

The best thing I can say about my visits were that they were very quick. I was in and out in about 15-20 minutes tops.

I've never in my life had a cleaning like this before. Not only did he rush through it but he was extremely rough and I had blood on my face (BOTH TIMES!) after the cleanings. I don't have weak gums. I floss regularly. And I know that a little bleeding is totally normal when you're getting your teeth cleaned, but to smear blood on my face and NOT SAY ANYTHING is completely unacceptable. I thought after the first time maybe it was an off day, but it happened twice. This was the worst experience I've ever had at the dentist. 

Thankfully I'm back with my original dentist after working out the insurance issue. Never again."
356,"NEVER AGAIN.

I needed to get an IgG test (food allergy test) and rather than going to the lab at my PCP, I went to VIK Medical.  I asked them two questions (a) can you do a blood based IgG test and (b) is it covered by my insurance.  Reception checked with the staff and they said yes to both.  Got the blood taken and was told they would call me in a week.  After a week, I called them.  Forgot to run the IgG test on my blood, call back in another week.  Called back after two weeks and got told that I was allergic to mold and cedar.  I explained that I went in for an IgG test and I was then told, 'we don't do that'.  Okay, so waste of time and $55.  Then 5 months later I get a bill for ~$400 for a test that I never requested.

STAY AWAY ... GO SEE AN ACTUAL DR!!!"
357,"A pig in lipstick. Seemingly nice urgent care, minus the quality care.  No bedside manner from the doctor or nurse.  Zero effort to seem human or to actually care enough as a physician to listen to symptoms. Rather, she was quick to judge and inadvertently made a few comments which were both ignorant and unhelpful.  In addition the room was dirty (unswept floors, overflowing biohazard disposal containers), big dirty scuff marks on the wall.  Never again."
358,Horrible experience.  Tried pushing an IUD/Implanon on me for the entire visit despite me repeatedly saying I was happy with the pill and didn't feel comfortable using either of those methods - even lied about the pill's effectiveness and side effects of the IUD/Implant.  Ended the visit by refusing to refill my pill prescription after the next few months unless I came in to get an IUD/Implant.  Never again.
359,"I once had a filling fall out and I gave tufts a shot. It was an absolute nightmare. It took 5 appointments (roughly 3 hours EACH) to even get them to attempt the filling...and when they got to it, the student took so long, all while waiting for her superiors to check every step, that one of the certified dentists had to finish the job.  Also keep in mind, they make you wear this insane hannibal lector type ""guard"" over your mouth and the tooth they will be working on, while your jaw is clamped wide open w/ a metal device. I nearly had a panic attack because I couldn't breathe or swallow properly. Insanely horrible device. My jaw was sore for several days after, and I could barely eat because of it. You're essentially a test dummy for students that basically have zero experience. The anesthesiologist even had the student inject my gums so she could ""learn"" and on her first attempt, she hit an artery!!! Never again. Pay the extra money to go somewhere else if you can afford it."
360,"Terrible. My 30min wait was actually 1.5hrs. Once inside lady stepped out to close down and clean up her station instead of tending to the sick patient whose been miserable waiting for her. Also answered a call while in the middle of working on my stuff. Lastly, when asked questions for my file to get an understanding of my illness she repeatedly interrupted my answers. I actually asked her to repeat what she said bc I was still talking. None of them seems to know how to use a keyboard with more than one finger at a time. Don't go here. It will waste half your day being out in public when it should be quick and get u back in ur bed for rest quickly. Never again....ever. Don't even usually write reviews unless it's really bad or really good. It's really bad."
361,"Nope. Never again. They gave me an expensive brace that my PT told me was NOT helpful and I shouldn't have been wearing in the first place. Spent about 20 seconds with me, didn't listen to what I had to say, didn't take any new x-rays or anything, just used the crappy ones from urgent care that didn't really show the other problems. Then my insurance wouldn't cover the brace, so while I worked it out and made payments on the stupid thing, I still got threatening letters and phone calls. Stay. away."
362,"If I could give this place negative stars I would. My husband showed up with our son at 7:30 pm and he has pink eye (eye red and oozing pus)- they refused to see him and told him they closed at 8 AND they will not look at anything eye related. Pink eye is a simple infection not an ""unknown"" eye condition where special equipment is needed. He needs prescription drops- super simple. Children's down the road not only got him in right away, they were shocked that the urgent care refused him. People at this urgent care were more concerned about leaving and getting their Saturday night party on than helping patients. This is a disgrace to Emory!!! NEVER again."
363,"The good news is I clearly know now where NOT to go if I or my wife need a hospital.

My step-dad was brought here on recommendation by the ambulance driver (who I hope was well paid for that terrible recommendation) and from the beginning until he was discharged, all we saw were long waits, an ever rotating cast of supposed experts who obviously don't share details who ask all the same questions repeatedly unaware of recommendations from the prior colleague who had been in 30 minutes earlier.  Yes, we encountered a nurse or two with a decent bedside manner, but it was hard to come away with anything other than these people genuinely don't care about their patients and don't really want to be bothered.

Mostly it was just difficult to get information.  My step-Dad, who had obviously suffered a stroke, was there for the better part of a day before receiving anything and before the family was given any sort of prognosis, and while they did perform a CT scan somewhat quickly, it was more than 24 hours before we heard anything about what the findings were.  It could easily be that everything they did was proper procedure, but for a family wondering if their loved one was going to be OK who know that stroke victims often have a very limited time to receive treatment before permanent damage occurs, the general lack of communication was very disturbing.

Mostly he just lay in bed in the ER doing nothing and not being given anything, with the family wondering what was going on. People would come in, look, ask him to move his arms and legs, write stuff down and walk off.  30 minutes later someone else would come in and do the same thing.  Very little was said to the family and when we did have questions, they answered very quickly and vaguely.  At one point, a doctor came in and when we asked why nothing had been done even though he had been there about 10 hours, the doctor actually said ""we have done something.  We have him lying flat and we are administering fluids"".  We then had to point out that there was NOT, in fact, an IV anywhere in the room and that since he arrived at 10:30am (it was now around 9pm), he had received no fluids and nothing to eat or drink whatsoever.  I'm sorry, but that's just blatant incompetence.  Upon realizing his own incompetence he simply said he would check into it and walked off.  We had many such incompetent encounters.  

They eventually transferred him to a room around 1am (after that 10:30am arrival) and that was after telling us around 4 or 5 pm (by 3 or more different people) that the room was ""being cleaned"".  Now I don't know about you, but if I start cleaning a room at 5pm, it would be pretty well spotless long before 1am.  They should have just been honest and said a room wasn't available and that they would let us know when one was.

If you want uncaring, incompetent service and want to be left in the dark wondering if your loved one is going to make it or not and enjoy poor communication (or no communication), then this is surely the right place for you to go.

Never again."
364,"Never again. First and last time there. Arrived on time to be herded like cattle (agree with another reviewer on this site) through a series of tests that were the same as what the referring optometrist did with a lot of waiting ""in the dark room"". This is where they put you with all the other waiting patients who have had their eyes dilated waiting to see the doctor. It reminded me of medical care in a 3rd world country. I watch one patient unescorted run into walls trying to get to the restroom. At several points throughout my visit I had to check with the front desk to make sure I was still in their queue. At 2 hrs I told them I had to be back at work. They said I was next (perhaps they say this to everyone to appease). After another 40 minutes and no update, no seeing a doctor I had to leave.  They never even called either. Can't wait to talk to my insurer about whatever charges they will be posting. Worse of all, this was supposed to be an urgent need appt. The optometrist got this appt for me because they actually had an appt opening versus trying to work me in. 
I have no idea who else does this work in the area but it will be a cold day in heck to get me there again."
365,"Never again!!!! Never, first Florida Blue says ins accepted however was charged not the $35 copay but $189 wth I'm too sick to care.  

No don't have Coronavirus symptoms therefore I guess I'm a nobody!! Had a 3 pm appt waited in lobby til 350 pm have had vitals taken and have been setting back here since then which makes my wait time 1 hr 45 min with an appt.    NEVER AGAIN. However would love to see Dr Deborah go into private practice she is awesome....."
366,"Terrifying ... large turnover in PA's, medical director incompetent, poorly educated staff on all levels. Never again."
367,"Their poor record keeping and appointment management could lead to tragic health complications. I'm done with this place after TWO consecutive screwed up appointments which led to my waiting nearly FOUR months to deal with an abnormal mammogram. Never again. Dr was here, office error, and sent me home. Wow."
368,"Never again. This place is much more expensive to see a PA. Simple ear infection,  $261 for the visit!"
369,"I was forced to go to this practice when my PCP moved his practice to round rock. I have seen 4 of the different doctors in this practice, each worse than the previous, and have been sick for over 6 months due to the sheer and utter incompetence of both doctors and support staff. I came to them with a case of mysterious chronic debilitating migraines and have been sent on a wild goose chase for the past 6 months of my life seeing specialist after specialist upon the referalls of my current doctor in this practice. Yet when I call to try an update them on the progress (or lack thereof) I am not listened to nor taken seriously by a single staff member. The only competent members of the staff are one of the front desk ladies and the physicians assistants. The doctor's are all pompous and emotionless and the nurses and CMAs are even worse. Don't bother using the patient portal that they tout as a convenient aide to care - they will not read what you wrote and will end up just asking for you to come in and pay to be seen as they lack the ability or skill to communicate with each other unless you are in their faces. Truly the most horrible medical experience I have had the misfortune to have to endure. Never again. These people are terrible and have no interest in actuality helping you get well. They just want to take your money and treat you subhuman. Would leave zero stars if I was able to."
370,"I needed to get my wisdom teeth removed and a co-worker had highly recommended to get it done here, with a specific resident. Though that resident was no longer there I decided to give it a shot anyway. Also, their hours are only weekday work hours so you'll need to take time off work to get anything done here.

1) Prep for the surgery - Initial consultation, very robotic with a student going down a list of questions and kept asking why I was there when I told her already. After booking, I wanted to know who would be doing the surgery and they wouldn't tell me. They said ""whoever it would be assigned to"". Don't I have a right to know who is going to drill open my gums? Horrible service.

3) Day of surgery - They called me in early because of some study they were doing that could help alleviate some pain. Asked me many questions just to find out I don't qualify for the study. Great, thanks. Then, I'm there waiting to for the room to be prepped because it wasn't ready for about 20 minutes.

4) During surgery: many faces coming in, not all introducing themselves, not explaining what they're doing. I felt like an object in the middle of the room because they were all talking to each other as if I couldn't hear. One DMD bald with glasses did not know how to put in a blood pressure cuff correctly, it was upside down. Same DMD did not put in the IV correctly, he messed up and tried again and when I looked there was all this blood over his gloves. I felt so uncomfortable but what can I do - they already Velcro'd my arms to the chair so I can't move. 

5) Post-op: Next day found the bruises on my arm from the IV, one from the insertion site and another farther up my arm. About 3 days post-op I'm starting to have concerns - the take home instructions say ""If you have any problems call"". I called to see if I can talk to someone about my concerns. Apparently none of them can talk on the phone, you need to schedule a follow up appointment for them to ""diagnose you"".I know other patients seem to have a relationship with their student and be able to text or call - but maybe it's because I was not a regular patient that I was treated this way. I had no communication, and just tossed around but I endured because I really thought they would do a good job. Never again.

TL;DR - Do not come here, do not waste your time, go to a professional oral surgery clinic, please."
371,"Not impressed.  Nice looking atmosphere.  My guy was arrogant, and the price was ridiculous.  Never again."
372,It's been over 4 weeks since being fitted and paying for new prescription eyeglasses. They're still not here. Never again....
373,Was told wait was 1-2 hours. 3 hours later and I'm still waiting. Never again. This is a bit outrageous.
374,"One star for the awesome receptionist. Came here after being referred by a nurse at work. Went to the health room at work due to back problems. Nurse took my vitals and informed me that I had hbp and fever. She gave me Tylenol to control my fever and told me to visit urgent care after work just to make sure everything was okay since it's going to take a while if I would have to schedule an appointment with my primary care because of the holiday. 

I hate hospitals. I rarely visit my doctor because most of the times I get sick, I can control it. And also because I just have really bad experiences with doctors. For example, I've seen 3 obgyns regarding my menstrual irregularity and all 3 had different diagnosis. 

Anyways, I debated about visiting urgent care but I trusted the nurse at work. I didn't really care about the fever or hbp because they're controllable. I was just worried about my back. I've had back problems in the past but It wasn't as bad as this current one. So basically I've been in pain for nearly a whole month. My awesome doctor asked me a couple of yes or no questions, clicked some stuff on the computer and diagnosed me with sprain to the lower back. And this was all done without any examinations. 

I guess what I'm disappointed about is that, I wasted my time. Earlier that day, my co worker, who has absolutely no medical education, diagnosed me with the same thing using process of elimination AND web md :) (im definitely going to refer her for a job at that clinic) I was hoping for a definite answer or at least some exams, an x ray or something just to try and see exactly what is going on instead of just an assumption based on a couple of yes or no questions. Oh and when I told my awesome doctor about a fever I had earlier, he discredited my nurse at work saying she might not know what a fever is. Disgrace. 

Just a tip for anyone reading this. Always  research the doctor and the clinic before visiting. Lesson learned. Never again."
375,"I went to this Lenscrafters because it is closer than the one I've previously used in Natick. Never again. My first complaint was that the optician who ""assisted"" me in directing me to the various selections of eyeglass frames steered me away from one entire section explaining that they were more for the ""younger, hipper"" crowd ( I do not have one foot in the grave yet ). This demonstration of ageism continued when, after inquiring about transitional lenses, he launched into a lengthy explanation about the difference between how a younger person perceives light vs an older person. He was utterly demeaning and clueless about it. When I pointed this out to him he was apologetic but again, I think clueless. He then went on to explain that because I needed a specialized prescription ( which was accurate ) he wasn't certain the glasses could be completed in a day but assured me he would text me after discussing the matter with the lab manager, and continue to keep me advised as the day went on.  At 4:00, after hearing nothing, I phoned and initially was put on hold for over 8 minutes. I hung up, they called me back and told me my glasses could not be completed for another 10 days. All this aside, their selection of frames is dated and limited."
376,"My wife had two procedures where Northside Radiology was involved. Both times the care was fine but the billing was horrible. 

Her EOB stated what we owed, and we paid both balances. Both times Northside Radiology sent her account to collections. I had to have the collections agency actually ""fix"" her account. 

Good care for the two hours she was there, but headaches for me months after.

Never again."
377,"Incompetent opticians and horrible customer service!!! 

First, they almost gave me the pair they had out which was chipped, I complained, and then they told me they could order the pair online and that I could take the store pair home temporarily. I thought everything was fine; however, they told me my frames would take 1.5-2 hours to be completed, so I waited around the mall. I came back after a little over 2 hours and they said 30 more minutes, I came 30 min later and then another ""25 minutes"" and then I called them and they said another 25 minutes! Their reasoning was stupid, because ""I had a difficult prescription."" If that is true, which would make no sense, then they should have known that the minute I gave them my prescription and they should have told me it would take a lot longer than 2 hours...at this point it's almost 9pm and the store is about to close, and they call me that my glasses are ready, so I get there and they say that they couldn't finish the pair and to come in another day to fix it, gave me a care kit, and sent me on my way. I am very dissatisfied with their service. The only reason I waited is because I need my glasses to see! Silly me for thinking they'd do their job correctly. Never again. Don't ever go there! Find another store!"
378,"Awful.  And I spent years in the healthcare industry, so I know awful when I see it.  Patient churn machine.  Went once, never again. It's a red flag when there are 4 patients with the same appointment time as yours for the same procedure. One poor woman waited so long she fell asleep.  When she didn't respond when they called her name (the waiting room was packed), they threatened to cancel her appointment when she woke up 10 minutes later.  Dr. Frank did an epidural injection and RUSHED it.  Not a place you want someone in a hurry.  I didn't use anesthesia for the procedure and it was brutal.  Went elsewhere (Republic Spine & Pain), thinking it was always that painful and was shocked when I realized my new doctor had finished the procedure.  Totally different experience.   Do NOT go to Austin Pain Assoc.."
379,"I don't usually write reviews this is my first but I decided to go bc It had excellent reviews on yelp and I wasn't really well. The office was really nice however I waited for over an hr and it wasn't even crowded the co pay was expensive and I will not attend this office again. I have never walked out without seeing a DR before but I was beyond angry! The doctor comes in and rudely says with arms folded ""did u have an appointment? Well you rushed me"" I simply asked the receptionist how much longer. I have never been treated so badly by a DR before never again."
380,"I'm so sad that Aspire is run by an Aggie dentist. My whole family used to go here *because* Dr. Hall is an Aggie. Guess there's a rotten apple in every basket.

I drove here once from College Station for a bi-annual cleaning appointment, and absolutely, 100% did not get my teeth cleaned. The people who work here initially seemed decent enough, but something about them was just off. Turns out that that off-ness is called dishonesty. 

What happened when I was there: chitchat/babble, x-rays, gum probing, chitchat/babble. Both hygienist and dentist insisted that I make another appointment for a very expensive deep cleaning, and sent me on my way. Not a lick (a-ha get it? lick. it's mouth related, ok?) of cleaning was done, and they did not care that I drove 2 hours for the damn appointment.
What happened after I left: insurance was billed for x-rays and insurance was billed for cleaning.

Well, I was a busy (and dumb) college kid when this happened, so I didn't bother fighting it at the time. Looking back, however, this whole experience was booty (as fellow Yelper, Rene H., would say). I later found out from my parents and insurance company that I can only have full x-rays done once every couple of years, and dentists make a lot of money off of them. Plus, I couldn't even go to another dentist at the time for a cleaning, because Aspire already claimed my cleaning for that 6 month span.
To add fuel to the fire, I also found out that they told my parents what horrible teeth/gums they had and scared them both into getting the very painful, very expensive deep cleanings. 

After the unnecessary, excruciating experience (Dad told me how awful it was and that I was lucky I blew them off), my parents said, ""Never again."" 
Hear that? Never. Again.

We now go to Dr. Timothy Wellik on Medical Parkway; we all like him a lot. And guess what? He happily cleans our teeth and doesn't pressure us into random shi-doodoo that we don't need."
381,"Run.. Run far away from here. They do not appreciate their patients and their time. I've waited for nearly 2 hours to see a doctor, before I gave up and went up the street to a different urgent care. 
I will never attempt to waste my time here again. For roughly $200, I do not understand how this business treats its customers(patients) with such disregard. I witnessed a shift change where the doctor and nurses left and came, with patients still waiting to be seen for more than an hour and a half. 
Never again. Not here!!
I highly recommend this place if you have a few hours to spare out of your life along with a couple hundred bucks!"
382,"Horrible experience...went there for an allergic reaction to medication.  They did nothing.  Don't go there...  Should have listened to a friend who said go to elsewhere.  Never again.  Patient's beware... they will charge you -regardless -if they treat you or not.  They could careless about if you got treated or not.  One more thing...I told them that I was having an allergic reaction to the medication and they tested me for the ""flu"".  Why would you not listen to the patient?  if this is a standard practice then the hospital should need pay for that charge.   Not how it works!   I was sent home and the next day..I""m in full blown hives from the medication reaction...""thank you for no help"".  If you have ever had hives..you will know that it is so painful and takes days to get rid of.

If I am ever taken to Mt. Carmel Hospital - I will asked to be taken elsewhere.    Heading Northwest Columbus if you know what facilities I'm referring to."
383,"""Good massage but head-sup on rude receptionist""

Like many people, I am a weekend warrior who punishes my body through an active lifestyle. I love to go my regular Registered Massage Therapist more often but alas my extended health benefit is limited. Hence I'm trying these cheaper Chinese massage places. Tried the one on Burrard St downtown called Kings Feet. Went once. Never again. Felt (and heard) very shady. 

Tried this Golden Feet place a couple of times now. People raved about Peter (the Great) here so I specifically asked for him. I think he's great. Very friendly, skillful, professional but oh man, can he make you feel pain. I'm used to painful massages cos I just want to get rid of the knots and scar tissues but I almost had to make him stop. Granted he had asked me if I would have preferred less force but I was determined to get through it. Glad I did. The knots felt much better afterward. And the 2nd time I saw him it was half as painful once the tight knots have been loosened up.

What I hate the most about going there is having to deal with the receptionist. Like many people have said, she is so RUDE. One time I had to change me and my partner's appointment times twice (trying to coordinate 2 people's schedules with 2 therapists' availability) making sure we will have enough time cushion so as not to be late for our appointments, she got sarcastic and said ""is it FIRM now?"". I called her out on that. She apologized and insisted she didn't mean to be rude. I will give her the benefit of the doubt and chalk it up to cultural differences but given the number of complaints about their service, I'd sure hope the business would take notice and improve on that."
384,"From a couple months ago.. Yes..I'm still catching up on reviews. Uggh. I should not slack.. Cause I'm compelled to catch up. 

Wow..almost a 5 star rating.. Wheeew. Not sure how that happened. The joint...is nothing more than a drive-thru in comparison to a restaurant.. If you're looking for a quick pop...in and out in 10-15 minutes..then this is the place for you. 

I needed some QUICK attention that my typical chiro could not do at the moment.. And I chose to go here.. Whoops. Big mistake. I hurt worse after leaving than when I got there and let me just tell you I was in pain. All the popping in the world was not going to help me. I needed to be ""thumped:""  whatever. I had huge knots in my back and neck. Could not turn my neck from sleeping wrong one night.. Discomfort went to my back from favoring..I got slam cracked/popped right in the middle of my back that hurt so so terribly bad. .. Never again. Nope. 

Went to my regular chiro and told him what happened...he said he could not tell me how many people have to gone there and said the same exact thing and then have to cone back to him for it to be fixed...Go figure. I have no idea how this place received these reviews.. I'm shocked.. But I do suppose I'm glad you all feel better...cause at the end of the day.. That's all that matters!! Honestly!! 

For me though..  I'll have to suck up any pain til I can get in to see my primary!"
385,"Ever have a kidney stone?  It kinda feels like someone you hate is stabbing a salt covered corkscrew into your back.  Newton Wellesley doesn't get this.

I came in at five am, in exquisite pain.  The triage nurse was not interested.  The waiting room was completely empty, yet they made me wait over an hour and a half.  At that point, I was lying on the floor.

They got me on a bed, but no one came.  I waited for at least an hour, throwing up in a dish and crying - the pain was so bad that I couldn't stay in any one position at a time.  My mother, horrified at seeing her kid writhe and sob, finally had to push the curtain aside and ask, ""can anyone here please help my daughter?  Please?""  Apparently, you have to *demand* care to catch the interest of attending physicians.  Yeah, I know this may sound bitter but I'm going to say it anyway - Hippocratic Oath my ass.

They found the stone, then couldn't find it.  They sent me home with no treatment except a shot of morphine.  The stone became a problem a few days later, but I'd be damned if I was to venture back into the house of pain.  I went to NEMC.  Never again."
386,"I will never step foot in this place again, We (my wife and kids) have gone here several times over the years and each and everytime they are 1-2 hours behind the appointment time. This last time was the final straw. We waiting a total of 4 hours for an ""quick check up""  (appointment was for 330 we left at 630) and after the front desk collected my co-pay the guy (which is so rude should of been fired on the spot if the owner knew how this manager talks and behaves to people), sorry for the rant, Again after we already paid our co-pay I choose not to buy glasses there and just wanted the Rx and the guy would not give me the Rx unless I paid a ""out side of your co-pay fee for the Rx"" I'm pretty sure this is illegal. Needless to say, Never again."
387,"Get ready to read! 

Went to Aspen Dental for a gum abrasion that has been scraping against my tongue after I had my wisdom tooth removed. 

I work from 8-4, and made arrangements to have an appointment for 8:30 when they opened and be slightly late for work. When making the appointment, they said to be 15min early to fill out new patient paperwork... Kind of hard when you don't open until 8:30. Luckily another employee showed up to work and let me in to start my paperwork. 

Was seated at 8:30 and they spent over an hour investigating other work needed to be done, with X-rays, and examinations. I had to explain to four separate people why I was there, so it felt as if no one communicated to one another, and really showed that they were more concerned with full treatment plans instead of the imminent cause for me being there. They spent a lot of time explaining to me all the issues with my teeth and what they felt I need to treat and take care of. 

By 10:30, they were running credit checks to see if I could get a payment plan for a $2,200 procedure to fix my gums in a two-session process. They ended up just charging me enough money to clear out my bank account, and I left. They also somewhat tried pushing their electric toothbrush on me during the credit application process. 

Over 3 hours late to work, and not happy with my experience at all. Never again. Can't wait for them to email me with their survey. 

Also, I saw a post from another person in 2015 who said they they seemed money hungry and inflate the prices for procedures and items needed for treatment. I guess things haven't changed much."
388,"Worst billing experience ever.  At my old dentist, they would give me the estimate cost of a procedure and an invoice after of my procedure.  This place surprises you after you have a procedure done.  It was the end of the day on Saturday and I understand that people want to go home after a long day, but at least look at my insurance instead of just telling me that the insurance company in general doesn't cover the cost of the procedure.  At least give me a paper invoice in detail of what I'm being billed for.  I called later on telling them that I had called my insurance and that it covered the procedure 80% and there was absolutely no claim put in because of what the lady had told me.  All of a sudden a claim was put in and I was overcharged by over $100.  They won't give me a refund right away.  TALK ABOUT SKETCHY.  NEVER AGAIN."
389,"YELP...Yelp...HELP...help your neighbor
You won't believe what is going on under the roof and between the four walls of this big, big, medical care (questionable) facility and the clever ways of the staff.  Always ask yourself if you need it or want it.  You always have the right to say no.  Do NOT let them manipulate you.  I did once.  NEVER AGAIN.

Funny thing...yesterday talking to an acquaintance, I did not mention my terrible challenging and unacceptable care or my visit at this hospital, when he blurted out, ""F______ ________ sucks.  The nurses don't care.  They are new and do not know what is going on.  You wait and you wait to come up empty while you are trying to get some level of acceptable care."" The level is sub-terrain, during the day unless you get a nurse who has a few lines around his/her eyes from aging a bit and a hard life as a nurse.  this is the best nurse to have...even if they are a little tired.  Unfortunately they put 90% of unexperienced nurses, just out of school on one floor. This happened to me and to my acquaintance.  So I know it is happening to many others.  Unacceptable.

Beware...this is the attitude of the hospital adminstration.  They really don't care about caring for the patient other than getting to the bottom of the problem and then possibly solving it while they enrich the organization financially...be aware that two facilities are being built, both with more than 120 beds, one in Winter Park and one in Mt. Dora, and the Apopka Hospital, a brand new one recently opened.  They are also in the real estate business building and renting brand new  apartments at high rates.

All that is going on while you lay there uncared for and then they try to force you into after care.  Do yourself a favor and do your homework.  Do NOT use the infusion company of the hospital (it is in Longwood, although there may be another one)..you will be very sorry...trust me.  Not only are they extremely, extremely unorganized they will not give you what the doctor ordered and they will tell many untruths and think you are believing them.  It is rather humorous that people there think the sick person and other helpful members around them do not know their game. Keep your paperwork and write down what they tell you when you leave the hospital. This helped me.  I have paper work with initials on them from the company.  Also keep any paperwork that comes when they deliver the product.  This will be very important when you take further action.

Oh yeh, if your product has to be mixed by them they will not mix it properly... which the net result leads to you not getting the correct amount of antibiotic into your veins...which means they will have you come back for more.  Another hospital visit, this time so very unpleasant and so unnecessary.  And of course, more hospitals and additions to hospitals will sprout up around you as you lay in the hospital bed once again.  Then more people will have to suffer through their horrible care and at this point unneccessary and created by them.

The home healthcare of the hospital...you can do better.  Do yourself a favor and choose one that keeps you up to date, not the ""I'm busy at that time, it will have to be at my time"" and the ignoring you for two or three weeks while you are under care and no one ever came out or makes contact with you.  Oh yes, they will record it as a ""missed visit"" and once again, they will bill your insurance and they will have more money to build more and do this horrible unacceptable care to more people.  Don't do it.

So please, help your neighbor...spread the word and write the inspector general of the state, the American Hospital Association and find the national medical organizations in Washington DC to alert them.  Of course, call Medicare, Medicaid and other organization to stop this vicious cycle.

Many thanks."
390,"The service was good in Labor and Delivery, the charges for services we didn't use I could do with out. $1600 nursery charge for a nursery we did not use is ridiculous. We specifically did not use the nursery a. because we wanted our child with us & b. to avoid unnecessary charges. What a horrible business practice, and no arguing about it after the fact, your on the hook... never again."
391,"I have always thought this practice was good, but with the addition of Dr. Le they have shot to great! She is new to the practice and I was worried. Never have I had a more friendly, professional and oh so gentle dentist. Wherever she goes, I will follow. I needed some restoration work repaired. What a difference in appearance and comfort. I had been living with discomfort unnecessarily because I dread going to the dentist. Never again."
392,"Their entire company is a complete joke.

Would only prescribe me medication IF I purchased through their pharmacy (at $60).... they refused to take my insurance and would not let me fill my prescription at my local Walgreens, which would have been $4. 

Oh and when I saw my PCP she said that the particular medication should have never been prescribed in the first place for my particular situation. 

Never again Zoom Care.... Never again."

I demanded a supervisor  he yelled at me to hold on.. never again.. supervisor Jean was a waste of time.. defended the bully.. looking for new pcp"
394,"I'm only giving a star because it's required to post a review. I was scheduled for a minor procedure. From the moment I got there, the pre op staff were the rudest people on earth. Apparently I don't change my clothes fast enough for the nurse charged with getting me settled in. 

The anesthesiologist was terse and rude. And clearly didn't approve of the fact that I'm in need of some dental reparations to my back teeth. Her look of disdain was palpable. Then something happened during the surgery with my heart. The operation got cancelled and they admitted me. When they removed the breathing tube, it must have been done with extreme force. My throat was scratchy for over a week. Getting a cough drop required permission from a doctor. It would have been quicker if I dragged my pole down to the store to buy my own. 

The majority of the fifth floor staff were the rudest people I've ever met. Clearly put out that they had another patient. This notwithstanding that I stayed in my room, with the door closed and never rang their goddamn bell until ten pm when I was in so much pain that I had to ask for some relief. They gave me Tylenol. Finally at 11 pm, I told them the Tylenol was not working, and I couldn't sleep. You'd think I had a million opioid scripts in my past, when the last one I had was in 2014. I finally fell asleep at 11:30 pm only to be woken at 6:45 by two residents to ask me how I felt......?

The only nice people were the actual surgeon and radiology. 

Strangely enough, the doctor is now SOLICITING me to reschedule. I will reschedule some day. But it won't be at that awful place. 

Never again."
395,"Made a simple call for the AC unit blowing out a bit warmer than normal air. When the company came out the guy went through the typical ..clean the condenser unit outside (wash with a hose???) suck out the drain line with a small shop vac, drop a bit of algicide into the line. 

Then they checked the unit for pressures. They said the unit was a pound low on 410 and added such. The problem is...why did it need freon? It's a closed evacuated system. There obviously must be a leak. Instead of saying hey, let's check to see where the leak is, no, just add some freon and pretend everything is fine. Charge us $250 for this??? When we called backed we proceeded to argue the points. Double charging, not fixing the issue at all, just a band-aide, the owner proceeded to tell me the caps on the low and high pressure were loose and I MUST HAVE DONE SOMETHING prior to them being there for the unit to be low. Also he concluded emphatically that the leak was caused because THE CAPS WERE LOOSE. 

Uh, you have to be kidding. Those are DIRT caps to protect the schrader valve. Seriously??? They are not under pressure. Besides, the caps were on so tight you couldn't remove them by hand...

So NO FIX, not even a thought of it just add freon, collect 250 and on to the next stop.

If this is the type of service you want and expect for $250 then you're in business. For us, never again. We are looking for a long term dedicated business that cares about the details of their customer. We still have no idea where the leak is. I asked the owner the question and he kept saying that would be another $95...for an electronic leak test. (Harbor Freight $65 unit that detects Freon leaks...)

Not this company."
396,"I got my crown done here about two years ago, it still hurts. I went to Tufts Medical private practice for years , they were superb! Once they moved, I decided to try Gentle Dental since they were closer to my home, never again. The cleanings were alright, I've had better. The customer service is okay, I left because I arrived 5 mins late and my hygienist was still with someone, and the secretary told me to leave. Very unprofessional on their end. Anyway it's been two years since Ive been there, but sitting here with crown still hurting decided to write a review.

Good luck!"
397,"I have waffled back and forth whether to post my first experience (4 stars) or my second experience (2 stars) but decided on the prior because I made the dumb decision to settle for a doctor other than the first one I saw originally.

If you find a doctor here you are happy with, stick with them.  Thats my lesson.  Dr. Brown saw me my first time, and asked tons of questions, and with good reasons.  I left feeling like the cost and time away from work was justified.

The second trip was on a day that my first doctor was NOT working and I decided, ""Hey, if the first doctor was that good, why not throw caution to the wind?"".  No, never again.  Not only did I get set up with another doctor, that doctor sent a......grad student? apprentice? whatever....in to give his thoughts first and report back to him.  Seriously CFFM, if you want to do that kinda stuff, I am sure there are free clinics where there are people there not paying to see you.  To make matters worse, the doctor just was not that helpful.  He offered choices, but the empathy I experienced on my first trip was nowhere to be found.

Long story short, there are many doctors here, some good, some not-so-good and some that are still in training-wheels, choose wisely and stick with the ones you feel do the best for you."
398,They got me in and diagnosed me immediately (less than 30min).  Waited over and 1.5 to get a damn prescription.  Never again.
399,Never again. I have a history of chronic back pain. and recently started having tremors and high blood pressure. on Tuesday july  28th 2015. my blood pressure went to 196/146 resulting in trouble breathing and a panic attack. dekalb paramedics arrived and took me out of my home to northside. they laughed and talked about things non related to me. once in the ambulance the female paramedic stumbled and fell into my right shoulder. the shoulder that i suffer constant pain from. once in the ER the same paramedic stood in the examination room stuffing her mouth with Cheetos. the nurses and staff said nothing.  I was informed that they dont treat chronic pain so i asked to leave. if they think they are getting one cent out of me they better think twice.
400,"I made an apt for my son at this dentist, verified with my insurer that we had ins., called booked the appt and receptionist told me that she ""thought there was a problem with the insurance the last time"" I told her I did not think so and to PLEASE call me back if there was a problem with it. She never called and we drove 25 minutes to appt., only to be told that she could never verify the insurance. We left, I drove home, called our insurance and they assured me that yes he IS insured! What a complete waste of time. They receptionist could not have cared less. Never again."
401,"Dr. Punjabi is a nice enough man, but the language/communication barrier has been an issue since Day One,  He never listens to me about my health concerns and when he replies to what I say, it has little to do with my initial concern.   He immediately tried to sign me up for his pyramid scheme, Ambit Energy, and has mentioned it numerous times during my visits.  His nurse is very nice and always professional.  She's certainly an asset to this practice.  His front desk lady is about as hateful and sour as Mrs. Kravitz, however.  Once she over-charged my debit card and instead of refunding the difference, she ""refunded/cancelled"" the entire amount and then charged me AGAIN!  Being a debit card, it did not process for several days, and I was out $200 for 9-10 days, due to her mistake!  Bad deal.  They are always trying to sell something here, it seems.  Vitamins, labwork, electric companies, etc.  They've hired a ""counselor"" named Ruben who charges people for ""services"" that were never requested.  When I balked, he became very rude and loud.  Never again.  I'm reporting this place to the Medical Board. If you are made of money and are going to a doctor for fun...go here...otherwise go elsewhere!  You'll like him at first, but that will change after a few visits when he turns into another person."
402,"I initially thought the staff was kind and knowledgeable, but I recently had a poor experience where I will not ever be returning. I indicated on my form the last time I had sun exposure. No one followed up with me about it or asked any questions, so I figured there would be nothing to worry about. I was severely burned by the laser and the Dr. confirmed it was due to the slight sun exposure I had a week prior. I'm only a few weeks out from my wedding and now have huge discolorations on my arm where you can distinctly see where each laser zap was conducted (and it's been a week)

I called Dr. Nanda to explain to him the situation, and he was more worried about covering himself and his business than he was about the situation and my burns and scars. He talked to me about the contract I signed versus holding his staff accountable for performing the procedure when they knew I had sun exposure a week prior. No one asked any questions or advised whether or not to move forward with the treatment that day, or use a lighter setting. I expect them to be the experts, not myself, so when there seemed to be no concern with my last date of sun exposure, I moved forward with the process, now regretting it. 

I wasn't offered anything from Dr. Nanda to make up for my bad experience aside from holding off on my laser treatments until fall.  Dr. Nanda left me an unnecessarily rude voicemail stating that I needed to ""take accountability"" because I signed a contract back in November ""in 6 different places"". I told him I wasn't looking to sue and didn't need to be reminded of where my signature was and he pompously said, ""oh I don't need to worry about that, I have 3 practices and multiple attorneys."" He also mentioned multiple times that he ""spent 20 minutes on a phone call with me which no other doctor would EVER do"". Truly not a staff that has the patients best interest at heart. No one ever asked me to come back in to see my burns/scars to determine the best way to move forward....the only follow up was to scold ME for coming in too soon after sun exposure. Never again."
403,"Service was perfectly pleasant, but a family nurse practitioner is not a doctor. How are these people allowed to diagnose? In the same breath you tell me all signs point to bacterial but you're going to treat my symptoms as viral? Without an explanation I explicitly requested?

Tried it. Never again. A nurse can draw my blood or wipe my ass, but I never want to hear one of their medical opinions, let alone diagnosis."
404,"If you like being ""diagnosed"" by ""doctors"" that have to freaking google chat with another doctor then go here! I was told that I had a raging ear infection that was about to rupture and that I needed hardcore antibiotics immediately. That if I didnt the infection could spread to my brain and I could die...when I walked out the ""doctor"" chased me out yelling at me that I had to pay (obviously) then she announced to everyone in the waiting room that I "" was refusing service"" Your damn right I am!! Well to make a long story short, I went immediately to my REAL doctors office and guess what? I didnt even have an ear infection....WOW...I would assume you learn to diagnose an ear infection in how to be a doctor 101. NEVER AGAIN."
405,"Took my son there for his first 2 years and never again. Dr Franz is always busy, never have any opening when is time for his check up and Angela was amazing but for the last 4 appointments she is never available, another Dr Craven was sweet but too young for me to trust her.
The last 4 times we waited 2 HOURS to be seen and they call you, we undress our kid, and after their weight we have to return to the front office, which the last time was too crowded so they put us in the back, break room for 45 minutes and forgot about ut there!!! Then they called us to get the shots in the open room in the middle of the hallway, the nurses were so rude, and put the bandaid so tight that when we got home my child had a lump and it was all red and swollen, something that didn't happen for 2 years. NEVER AGAIN!!!!"
406,"Dr Patalano has terrible bedside manner, does not look at you when speaking nor listen to you, interrupts you, and makes you wait, books too many patients. My dad has cataract surgery with him and would not use him again. My dad needs medication for parkinsons every three hours, and I struggled to get his meds and the timing of the surgery. It was delayed 4 hours! And he never spoke to us after surgery nor apologized for the delay. Never never again."
407,I was with them too until the company I used to go through the first health network went bankrupt! First health customer service was awful and the website was by far the worst I've ever encountered on the world wide web. Never again. Evil. No surprise to see every review on them is one star
408,"Let's start off by saying you could recruit a bunch of chimpanzees to run this office and they would do a better job than this staff. I wish I could say things had improved since my last review, but they only got worse and today was the last straw. I called to make an appointment for my son with Dr. Kraus who he has been seeing for Accutane. ( acne med).Dr. Kraus has drastically reduced his hours and they were not in sync with my son's job, so I said I needed a new doctor. Anyone. I asked repeatedly if they knew if my son was on his last month of Accutane or did we have a month to go. Of course, they said they didn't know. So, they knew this was an Accutane follow up visit. I made an appointment with a new doctor in the practice so we could finally get an answer on the Accutane issue .I got a call and an email telling me I needed to fill out all new paperwork which didn't make sense because I was just switching doctors, not the practice. But fine, I took the time to do that. They also told me on the phone to bring in all the compounds that Dr. Kraus had prescribed so the new doctor could take a look at them. I did that. They said to arrive 15 minutes early with a photo ID and Insurance card. I did that. At around 1:35pm, ( we arrived at 1:00 for a 1:15 appointment) the nurse in the new doctors office came to me and said, ""Oh, you are here about the Accutane. I said yes and she said the new doctor couldn't do anything because Dr. Kraus had to sign off on Accutane paperwork releasing it to the new doctor. I flipped. I said I had spoken to 4, yes 4 people, in Dr. Kraus's office explaining what I needed and not one of them told me that policy. So... my son left work early (lost pay), we lost an hour of our lives we will never get back, I had to pay $6 for parking, and my son ( who is autistic) was getting very upset. Not to mention I recently had spine surgery and with a brace on and a cane it is very hard and painful to walk. I felt like I had steam coming out of my ears like you see in cartoons. The only call I will ever make to this practice again is to send all my son's records to the new dermatologist. And how much do you want to bet they will send someone else's records? STAY AWAY FROM THIS PRACTICE UNLESS YOU WANT TO FEEL LIKE YOU ARE WALKING INTO A DISORGANIZED ZOO. NEVER AGAIN. DON'T SAY I DIDN'T WARN YOU!"
409,"Went in yesterday for an infected bug bite. The doctor could not have been more unpleasant and disengaged. Told me to wash my leg but offered no option to do this, so I got my foot in the sink and rinsed it. Although I said I had allergies to antibiotics, that was all she offered. I asked Dr. Easton what I should do if I have a reaction to the pills and was told to go to the ER. I received better info with far more kindness from the Fred Meyer pharmacist. Never again."
410,"Jon Ric is a salon in Vinings that is located off of Paces Ferry road in the same complex as Canoe. 

There are two different locations, one for hair and nails and the other for skincare and massage. Both in the same complex, just different buildings. 

Parking is easy and the inside of the location is ok. 

I came in with a Groupon for a Blowout. I have had several blowouts in town, and compared to about 4 other salons, this was the worst.

Anytime I have a blowout, they put in products like mouse, hair protector, serum, etc, basically several products to keep the style for more than one day. Also every blowout I have had includes the use of hot tools for finishing touches and touch ups such as curls and taming frizz. 

This was just a blow dry. That's it. She used a product for conditioning, and hairspray, but they really did not work very well. Also, throughout the entire experience I was never offered anything to drink, water, soda anything! Everywhere else I have been for a blowout I am offered a drink and it arrives to me before I get to the chair, Water, prosecco, anything. Not here. 

My stylist was very sweet and very friendly, I do not blame her entirely for the poor blow out, but the practices of the salon that led to the poor end result. 

I showed the stylist a picture of what I wanted before the service and she said it would not be an issue, and when she finished, there were no curls, no volume, she literally just blow dried my hair exactly as I could do at home, lots of frizzies, it did not look glamorous at all. I said this to my stylist and she said a ""thermal styling"" was extra. This is not specified in their website, the Groupon or when I booked my appointment and made specific requests.

I host a podcast and go to several events per month where my hair has to be on point and I was VERY specific that my hair had to last all day. Previous blowouts achieved this with ease, but this look fell and became frizzy while I was waiting for my Lyft to the event I was hosting. 

I had to be photographed and on video with bad hair all day and it was really disappointing. I usually go to Blo by Ponce city market, they are more expensive and out of the way, but the end result is stellar. I decided to try Jon Ric because it is very close to my house and convenient, but never again. 

Overall I am so disappointed to give a poor review of a local salon, but I cannot recommend them for a blowout. The look did not start off great and by the end of the day looked awful. I could have done a much better job myself at home."
411,"I was told to go to the ER for an emergency CT Scan. I get there around 2pm.  I didn't leave until 8pm.  I was given excuse after excuse as to why it was taking so long to be seen. Only 1 doc for triage.  I watched as the poor excuse for a patient advocate call security on a family of 3, which included a child, for asking a question. Once in back, I laid there on a bed for over an hour before someone told me what was going on, then another 45 minutes to be discharged, only after I called for a nurse.   Never again. I would take my chances at Grady."
412,"Went in for a cavity fill. They took me back and gave me the Novocain and said ""okay we will let this sit for about 10 minutes and come back"".....ONE HOUR LATER they came back and asked if I was numb yet. Are you kidding me?!  Then I wasn't getting numb on some other teeth that they started drilling on, so I wasn't taking the Novocain. Not a big deal, but they gave me 3 more shots and now my entire face was numb when I only had work done on the right side.  I had no pain before I had these ""cavities"" and now I have tons of pain. And they think I'm going to come back and get the other side done? Absolutely not!  Keep in mind, I take really good care of my teeth. I was just at the dentist (the dentist I've gone to since I was a kid back in my home state) 6 months prior to this, and they are telling me I've gotten 9 cavities in 6 months?! What a joke. Never again."
413,"All I can say is NEVER AGAIN.  Brought my partner to Emergency at the North Shore Mall location, for severe head and chest pain. Encountered the MOST uncaring and rude staff (including the doctor who was the worst one of all).  Although they ran all the right tests to rule out any serious conditions, they left us there in the room for extended periods of time without ever popping their heads in to ask a simple ""are you doing ok?"". Finally, after 5 hours, we rang the buzzer and had to ask for all the results from tests.  How long were they going to leave us there? WE had to tell the doctor to check the blood tests or I guess he just wasn't going to.  This place is pathetic, unprofessional and we will never think of going there again. Upon leaving, they asked for the $200.00 co-payment.  They didn't get it."
414,"Pros: quick and easy 
Cons: expensive and they actually never do anything for you. Went in 3 months ago for lower left side pain and they thought it was just constipation. Went to see a specialist and it took him less than 5 min to figure out what was wrong w me instead of the people at this clinic who were so dumbfounded. I have a cyst on my ovary that's the size of a plum. Thanks for misdiagnosing me and wasting my time and money. Never again."

416,"if only yelped allowed 0 stars. 

well first, i called to find directions cause it's absolutely confusing and i had never been here. as i was on the phone with the lady, she was rude and was being an absolute smarta**. 

i could go on and on about the way i was treated in there. but Betsy, i believe her name is. poor thing, didn't know what she was doing. she gave me false information and made me feel not welcome. 

i don't ever plan on coming back here. i was looking forward to meeting the doctor, but unfortunately after being treated the way i was with that front desk lady or nurse if that's what you wanna call her. never again.

betsy girl, do better"
417,"Tell me how can someone have two failed fillings in 6 months? Yes that's Dr. Abboud for you. The cleanings are mediocre and all they are interested in is making a profit. I ended up transferring to another dentist who doesn't take my insurance. I'd rather pay out of pocket then deal with Abboud. They don't communicate with you either, you've got to pry and ask questions about your mouth. Never again. Avoid this office!"
418,"As a regular things changed here.The fourth 5ine cancelled after the blotch job done to me.  They cancel every apt almost to a point how do these people stay in business. Cov19 is always they excuse to send you to far west blvd. But in truth they want you to spend $$$$$ more on other procedures. It got to be a hit on the patients since people ate now trying to sav since my businesses closed. The last procedure she did a 1 to two min which ran out the door to try to make more money. And left me with bumpy lips I had a friend correct it, I am going to another reputable spa near my location. They turned to make as much money as they can and makeup for the quick procedures they do on you. Rather your happy or not they treat you poorly. Mind you went way downhill try another spa never again. Trying to make up dollar revenue on your expense. Never will I send any more patients to them. My friends read my reviews and know how truthful I am. It another business going soar. When I called to complain the rude front desk  girl hung up on me since they dont fit there narrative on negative reviews. Like it or not its wrong. I also go to two orher great spas not worth the quick procedures you get here."
419,"Worst experience ever. It took numerous calls to schedule an appointment for my surgery, which he completely botched. My breathing is worse than before. As soon as he took the stent out 24 hours after the procedure, my nose went back to the position it was in before - with even MORE blockage. Yet I continually get bills that his office assured me was covered by my insurance. I have tried to call the accounting person several times and they do not answer nor return calls. I even sent a letter. No response. They DO however send collection notices. I have never had a worse experience with a doctor or surgery. Never again."
420,"I think I had the same doctor that Maggie had. Going there with what seemed to be complicated symptoms, the doctor greeted me not with a ""hello,"" or ""how can I help,"" but ""Tell me in one sentence why you're here."" My own PCP has always said that the best diagnosis comes from listening to the patient, something this guy knows nothing about. When I saw my own doc a few days later and told him why I was prescribed ABC for XYZ, he said ""You don't have XYZ, stop taking the ABC,"" and proceeded to be an actual doctor and treat my problem accurately. Never again."
421,"I got surgery here. Worst experience of my life. They forced me to leave while still on anesthesia. I had to walk down their extremely steep steps right on to Newbury st when i could barely walk. The doctor put my iv in wrong so i had a bruise for 3 weeks. I was vomiting blood for the rest of the day. I was sick for a whole week after that, could not keep down any food, could not go to work. When i went back there to make sure i didnt have an infection a very young dentist told me several times he thought i was pregnant or had the flu. Very offensive. Then they kept sending me the wrong bill.  Never again."
422,"Do not even waste your time here. I went this past weekend and was in and out so fast, I don't even think they wrote my name down. They told me i was 'healthy' and to come back if I don't feel well in another week. Well I went to another clinic and I have bronchitis. 
Never again."
423,"I'm honestly quite baffled and not sure where to begin. I'm sure that ZOOM has its place in the medical care world, and judging by the reviews, others have had firsthand experience with it being useful, but for the love of me I cannot figure out where it fits in and what services it can provide better than your GP or the ER. 

I ran afoul of ZOOM's one-price-fits-all business model earlier this week, after having had a couple of hypoglycemic episodes. I considered heading straight for the ER (I've just moved back to Portland and don't have a GP or insurance currently) but a couple of friends convinced me to give ZOOM a try first. Lesson the first learned: don't listen to your friends when it comes to medical advice! I walked to the ZOOM in the Pearl, but they were all booked for the day so they made me an appointment at the NW 23rd location. I went. 

The one positive side of all of this was that everyone I interacted with at either ZOOM location was very nice. The receptionists and the NP I saw were all very pleasant and seemed genuine. However, the actual level of care I received... well, let's just say that the NP listened to my symptoms, took my vitals (BP, heart rate, temperature, the very basics), more or less confirmed my self-diagnosis (hypoglycemia brought on by exhaustion and dehydration) and told me that I should go to the ER for an EKG if I wanted to. For this experience I was charged $145. 

Okay - I get that the flat rate charge can be a great deal if you have an issue that ZOOM can actually help you with (other reviewers mention antibiotic prescriptions and stitches) but charging the same for a ten-minute appointment consisting of a brief conversation and the measuring of vitals is just absolutely wild. I ended up going to the ER anyway and greatly regret not going there in the first place and wasting time and money on ZOOM. Never again."
424,Horrible 'adjustment'- barely any pressure. Loud backpacking bragging by other doctor. No reassessment - just told to come back next week. Never again. She didn't even perform the one move to get my hip moving (which always works) even after I demonstrated it to her. Still in pain. Never again
425,"Awful. Dr. Jalaja Rao was dismissive of each thing I discussed with her. I am a middle-aged man who always puts off seeing his doctor. I thought I would be responsible and ask about some issues that had been concerning me for a while and get a basic check-up, only to be treated as if I was making things up.

I mentioned that one of my feet was flatter than the other, resulting in slightly displaced hips, which would result in hip and knee pain. (As a teenager, my doc noticed some slight scoliosis as a result of this.) But first - she dismissed outright that I could have one flat foot, and one not. WTF? I'm here - look at my feet right now! Zero examination. Just dismissive.

I had run a half marathon and had conspicuous knee pain for a month afterwards. I was not making this up, and she could have examined me to even the slightest minimal degree. Or she could have referred me to a specialist. No, she just ignored by concerns. The foot issue was one of 2-3 other issues I had, that I'd rather not get into in a public review.

So - her bedside manner was blatantly disinterested and dismissive of my concerns. Never again.

I have no opinion of the other doctors, as I never interacted with them."
426,"If you care for and love yourself or children you WILL NOT choose this place. Professionalism is not an act that the staff at Franklin Dental partake in. Inexperienced and snotty would be the best term to describe the staff at Franklin Dental. I am 99% sure these ladies are under paid and under trained.  Disappointed is an understatement, the wolves that raised the manager should be caged. NEVER AGAIN will I ever step foot in this trash pit. NEVER AGAIN."
427,"8/27/18 Made my appointment online the day before. Showed up 5-10mins early to fill out paperwork. Was so sick. Get there and the Doctor is running late. I wait 30mins. Saw the doctor for maybe 3 1/2 mins.  wrote my prescription and left.  Got my bill yesterday. $281!!! Never again. Save yourself and go to Concentra on Spring, a fraction of the price. You live and you spread your knowledge.  Never again.

Also worth noting, the visit was $492.02 before they ran it through insurance. Welcome to America."
428,Great dentist and wonderful staff!! I have told all my friends to go see Dr. Matar. He is extremely gentle and really made me feel comfortable with his knowledge and skill. Haven't been to another dentist since and will never again.
429,"They can't be serious. Is anyone paying attention over there? I tried to book Saturday appointments for my family of three to have cleanings. They screwed up our appointments so many times I ended up having to take time off work and go. Then I'm told that by doing that I switched dentists and would need to sign more paperwork and would no longer be able to get Saturday appointments. They acted as though I was being privileged to meet the dentist. I swear I heard fanfare when he walked in the room. Why are dentists so arrogant? 

Oh and the up charging others have mentioned...it's real. They tried to get me for a mouth guard, re-doing a root canal that gives me no trouble, and a fluoride treatment for double what it usually costs because they were out of the regular kind. Huh? You ran out and are charging me more? 

Never again. Even though I get appointment reminders occasionally for appointments I didn't make....still. Never again will any of my family go here."
430,"We had a horrible experience here. We brought my son in for Dehydration and the nurse went to give him an IV. He is 2 and she tried to stick him in the arm & failed in both because he would move his arm (because he is 2). I continually tried to tell her to try his hand. Finally she tried his hand, she had not back up nurse, stuck him, then didnt know what to do next. I had to push the IV fluids, then she dropped the cap to the line, my sons blood was squirting all over me & my husband. It was Horrible. I yelled for other nurses. The one that came did not speak very good english and could not get what she was asking for to secure the IV into my little guys wrists. She was not gentle at all, messy (leaving trash and wrappers everywhere).While cleaning my 2 year olds blood off of my husband, it was all I could do to keep my composure. NEVER AGAIN.  The doctor on call was great, but the nurse's not so much."
431,"Terrible experience.  We were advised to have test for influenza that was absolutely not necessary and although we have decent health insurance, we were liable for over $40 out of pocket expenses.  Also we did not see a physician.  It should be called Physician Assistant Express.  There's a reason they don't put their qualifications on their name tags...  Absolute waste of time and money.  Never again."
432,"I have not been to this office in a number of years, but feel compelled to add my two cents.
I have been hypothyroid for fifty (yes 50) years.  I went to Dr. Scumpia for about four years.  During that time, I saw the doctor on my first visit and never again.  It was a different PA every time.  I had a complaint about numbness in my feet that I reported every time I went in.  Got strange looks (I guess because I am not diabetic) each time, but no comment, suggestion, or concern.  (Several years and a back specialist later, I have learned that it is not uncommon with thyroid patients)  
The final straw was showing up for my appointment without my insurance card and being told I could not bring it back later in the day; I could not fax a copy; and they would not see me unless I paid them $170;00 out of pocket for the visit.  I will tell you I had been going there with the very same insurance for about 4 years, so no change in anything.  I paid the fees rather than have to reschedule and pay their charge for canceling late.  Later, I find that my insurance company inadvertantly sent Dr. Scumpia's office the reimbursement for that visit.  I called them and requested my my money and was told they would mail it.  For the sake of brevity, I will just say that many phone calls and approximately six months later, I stood in her office and raised my voice and said that I would not leave there without my money!  Two days earlier they told me it was in the mail for like the fifth time.  I have never gone back to the factory of chicanery.
."
433,"Front desk is lacking.  I've instructed them to change billing to my new insurance before my appointment, and given them my new insurance info, but they did not make the change.  Instead, they submit a faulty claim to my OLD insurance plan, and now I am left dealing with all the headaches of correcting a collosal failure on their part.  F-.  I agree with all other reviews that the front desk is rude, but also will add that they are incompetent.

I had an abnormal nevis (mole), type 1 that Dr. Godkin removed.  9 stitches for something smaller than an eraser seemed a little excessive.  She initially didn't say anything was evident with my ""full body scan"", but then handed me a cue card with descriptions of different moles that should be of concern.  I noticed one of them looked exactly like a mole in my pelvic region and asked Dr. Godkin's advice on the matter.  She said we could biopsie it if I wanted to.  I was a little put off, being put in the position of having to decide the matter with no real knowledge of the risks of not removing it.  I think the closest she got to look at it was 3 feet away, because it was in my pelvic region.  The whole body scan/exam only took 2 minutes, and she was NOT THOROUGH...  A thorough exam would have involved looking between my butt cheeks.  Gross, perhaps, but important too.  Anyway, I asked her what she thought I should do and she said it was up to me.  I asked her what the possibility was it could be an issue and she said it depends...  Basically, she was not helpful for me, and she did not tell me it was a minor issue of no real concern, and in hindsight it was extremeley premature to remove it, which she did with the 2"" of skin surrounding the eraser-head sized mole.  

9 stitches people...  how much do doctors charge insurance per stitch?  I think this is a greedy practice.  They won't see you until you pay which is always a tell-tale sign.  

I also wasn't happy to have them operate on me with the door open so everyone walking by could watch me with my pants down.  Is that malpractice or something?  Litlte respect for privacy, and little courtesy overall.

Never again...  find someone else that your friends, coworkers, and family likes.  PS _ My wife saw the other doctor, Wienfeld, and she also did NOT like being treated like a cow in a slaughter yard.  2 mins for her full body exam/scan..."
434,"I went to Beth Israel to get some genetic testing done. Prior to the appointment, I did some research and also knew some other people that got the testing done, and so I knew what type of testing I wanted (FISH). There were some specific genetic defects that I wanted to test for and so I called the clinic up and scheduled an appointment for genetic counseling and to ultimately get tested for the specific genetic defect that I was interested in. I chose Beth Israel because they said they could do the specific test I has asked for. I was informed that I had to get genetic counselling done and then get the testing done.

I attended the genetic counseling appointment with my wife, and we specified the type of testing that we wanted to get done, and the specific area of my chromosome that we wanted to test. We expressed this to the counselor and the counselor wasn't sure if they could do the testing. We asked for the pricing of the testing and she said all of the testing would be 'inexpensive' and didn't look the prices up! We told the counselor to let us know if they couldn't perform the testing we has asked for. We were willing to pay for the cheaper testing and were under the impression that Beth Israel could perform this testing. They took my blood sample and said they would get back to me. Two weeks later I got a voicemail message saying they couldn't perform the cheaper FISH testing that I has asked for and instead performed the more expensive full array testing. This ended up costing THOUSANDS more than what FISH testing should have been. They performed this test without my permission and then they billed me for it!

When I received the bill with the testing that I didn't consent to, I called Beth Israel and expressed my concern with the genetic counselor. She didn't know what each line item in the bill was and said she would ask the lab. When she got back to me, she told me the lab didn't know either! They then referred me to billing. I called billing, and of course they didn't know either. Billing then referred me to Patient Relations. I called patient relations and worked with a representative from patient relations over the course of a few(!) weeks. I explained the problem and the patient relations person investigated the issue by talking to the parties involved (primarily the genetic counselor). The patient relations person ADMITTED FAULT that Beth Israel performed testing without my permission and they should have called me and asked prior to performing the more expensive testing, especially since this wasn't emergency testing. The patient relations person did inform the genetic counselor of their wrongdoings. However, they STILL said that I HAD TO PAY for the testing! Apparently, this hospital that performs testing that the patient doesn't consent to.

This whole process took over a month, and ended up being a total waste of my time because I explained to patient relations everything they did wrong and they admitted guilt, but they still made me pay the bill! Trying to dispute the charge for over a month was a total waste of my time! So now I am out multiple thousands of dollars and additional time from my life. This testing was probably over $2.5k more than the cheaper testing than I wanted. 

In conclusion, I will NEVER go to Beth Israel again and I will tell everybody I know that Beth Israel is terrible. Boycott them. Go to Brigham and Women's and call it a day. Never again."
435,"I read all the bad reviews but wanted to give it a shot cause I needed a simple cleaning. Nope, never again.  I had the same treatment as everyone else. 

After x-rays and gum measurements, I was told I needed a deep cleaning rather than a normal one. I haven't had a cleaning in a while so that wasn't overly surprising.  However, when I asked to have a basic cleaning for the sake of time, I was told no because once they determine you need a deep clean, you're no longer eligible for a basic one.  The dentist was in the room less than 2 minutes to simply confirm I needed a deep cleaning then left.  I spent an hour in there and literally left with nothing more than a referral for another dentist at their office and prodded gums.  

Only giving two stars cause the staff was friendly but definitely won't be returning here.  Even if you are just in need of a simple cleaning, I'd go elsewhere."
436,I'm pretty cool about a lot of shit because I understand that everyone is human but these people are seriously disappointing. I have never felt so confused in my whole life after an appointment. First of all he gave me a medication I was allergic too which is in my chart because I have been there once before. And he gave me allergy medicine for a flu. Don't remember his name but never again.
437,"Dismissive doctor and the office ""couldn't find the xrays"" sent by our doctor's office until we insisted we weren't taking new ones and that we had faxed them ahead of our appointment.  Dr's advice - do what doesn't hurt and don't do it if it does hurt.  So - if my dad is trying to sleep in bed but can't because of his shoulder pain, then what?  We went the first time and got nothing, tried a second visit.  Never again.  Save yourself the frustration."
438,"I wish I could give this place zero stars.  The staff is very rude and tell you ""I will call back"" but never do.  Paid bill then accuse you of not paying it.  The place is not organized at all.  No communication between staff.  Took a month  to get a report that should have only taken 2 weeks.  Never again."
439,"I am terrified of needles but the last time I got my blood drawn, the experience was almost OK., so when I approached this blood draw, my nerves were pretty calm.

I explained that I was nervous. 

The first woman who tried to take my blood was very sweet, and tried to distract me by talking about my work, but the blood draw took forever. 

Then she told me my vein collapsed, which has NEVER happened.

Then she tried on more time in that arm.

Then she tried 3 more times in the other arm.

Then I cried.

Then she said since she upset me she would have another woman try.

The other woman pulled out a creaky dusty bed, and propped my arm on a tissue box.

She did not smile or speak to me.

She was able to successfully get it in.

The whole thing took an hour.

Never here. Never again.

Way to compound my fear of needles."
440,"Horrible wait! Checking in is fast but even with an appointment and no one in waiting area, I still had to wait for two unacceptable hours. This is not the first time, I came back only because my referring Doctor convinced me to. But never again. The technologist or whoever is to fault for the wait are highly irresponsible and inconsiderate."
441,"My daughter and I went in for the same symptoms in jan. without even looking at us she decided we have ""viral infections"". when i complained of the white spots in the back of my throat-she then looked and did a rapid strep test~~which she dropped on the floor after the same was taken. My daughter and I left with each a zpack-mine for the positive strep and hers to prevent her ""viral infection into turning into strep(???) upon getting home, two of her pills in her zpack were missing. if all this wasnt bad enough when i called the billing to dispute the $150 bill because my daughter has dual insurance, im told her first insurance was never received___which is impossible because its my only insurance so i know it was provided. they screwed up didnt bill it properly and after giving this information to the woman over the phone she says it will be rebilled and then HUNG UP ON ME!!! well, I called back and asked her why she did this and im given a robot answer of its not her fault she doesnt know why it wasnt billed properly and she ""wont be reprimanded by me""-so apparently her way of solving this was to hang up on me instead of apologizing for any confusion and telling me have a good day before hanging up, ya know what someone with decent customer service skills would do. I asked her if her employer was aware that this is how she treats her patients and she said she'd""let her know"". Im done, never again. there are alot of doctors offices in orlando and i will gladly drive the ten minutes further to avoid an office that provided sub par care+incompetent billing+rude staff no thank you!!!!"
442,"I wouldn't send my worst enemy here. My family has had to visit twice and both times we were severely let down. The second time was for my daughter and her asthma. The ER Physician said there was nothing else to do and let the asthma run its course... last time I checked, asthma was not a virus... I have been in the medical field for over 10 years and have never once heard to let asthma run its course. Never again."
443,"Review of Urgent Care.

I only went to SECHC Urgent Care out of convenience as it's near my work and I didn't have the time to get over to my regular provider.  Never again.  

The Positive:
While check-in did take awhile, the receptionist was really nice and had great customer service skills, which resulted in me not minding standing there waiting.  After check-in I was only in the waiting room for about ten minutes before getting called in.  I really liked the medical assistant who took my vitals and whatnot.  She spent a lot of time with me and asked important questions.  

The Negative:
My SECHC experience went downhill when the Nurse Practitioner, Deborah Sheldon, walked through the door.  She scowled at me upon meeting...a bizarre scowl that kept reappearing over the next two minutes spent together.  I don't know if she has Aspergers but there was something very off about her ability to connect and communicate.  She kept looking at me as if I had leprosy or was a bank robber.  And yeah, two minutes, that's about all the time she gave me.  The first thing she said to me was ""(inaudible mumble about cold symptoms)....what do you want from me?""  She seemed so angry and frustrated when asking me ""what I wanted from her"" that I felt a bit intimidated and didn't know how to respond, which isn't helpful at a medical appointment, especially one that is apparently only 2 minutes long.  I mean...usually when I go to the doctor I'm feeling horrible and honestly want a pat on the back, some reassurance, and guidance on how to get better.  Is that a crazy concept?  I didn't get any of that from NP Sheldon.  I really had some serious concerns about my symptoms, but I didn't get to address them with her.  She left the room at one point, seemingly mid conversation (if you could call it a conversation) and reappeared with a useless discharge sheet and a random man in tow behind her.  I thought the man worked for SECHC and was coming in to change a light bulb or something maintenance related.  Not that a maintenance man scenario would of been appropriate...but nope, it was worse...he was a patient.  I guess Deborah Sheldon's way of signaling the appointment is over is to bring the next patient into the room while you are still in it.

Just a very bizarre experience that was anything but helpful.  I'm really frustrated that my insurance is being charged for this.  I mean, other than being scowled at and spoken to rudely, what exactly am I paying for?  She didn't even do a strep test, despite me telling her I have an extensive history of strep and sinus infections.  I bumped into a colleague on my way back to work and asked if they had ever used SECHC for urgent care.  Low and behold, colleague had the same exact experience as I did...with NP Deborah Sheldon.  

While I did experience some positives at SECHC, I have to give one star because the most important part of the experience was a complete, shameful disaster.  If you are going to go to SECHC, make sure you don't get assigned to Deborah Sheldon.

UPDATE:
Two days after my appointment with Deborah Sheldon I was able to get over to my regular medical providers office.  I was in absolute agony the two days between appointments, the pain in my throat so bad that I ended up self treating (responsibly) with old prescription pain meds from a past surgery.  The night before I got in to my doctor's office one of my tonsils was expelling white curds and blood, which I've never experienced before.  It felt as if someone had fired a shotgun at my throat.  When I went in to my regular medical providers office, she spent the full scheduled 20 minutes with me.  In that time she did a strep test.  She looked at me as if I was a human being and treated me with respect.  She asked me questions.  She welcomed my questions and provided me with understandable, non-hurried answers.  In the end when I walked out the door, I felt as if someone had given me a hug without actually giving me a hug.  And that is how a medical appointment should be, unlike the experience Deborah Sheldon provided.

I'll compare the two discharge plans to illustrate Deborah's failure to diagnosis and treat.

SECHC/Deborah Sheldon's Discharge Plan: 
*Use Neti Pot and Afrin

My PCP's Discharge Plan:
*ANTIBIOTICS REGIMEN
*600MG Motrin 3x/day for at least 3-4 days
*Liquid Codeine and Guaifenesin (Cheratussin) 10ml every 4-6 hours as needed,   max 60ml/day
*Cepacol Cough Drops for numbing
*As needed OTC cold treatments that do not contain ingredients that double up on ingredients on this list (such as Guaifenesin)
*Warm soothing liquids like soup or tea with lemon and honey.
*Cold numbing foods like popsicles and pudding.
*REST

Sort of a massive difference in the quality of care."

***Went to another dentist who is a long time family friend, whom I know isn't attempting to rip me off.  He confirmed everything this practice recommended was absurd and is simply doing 2 cleanings in a six month span instead of the usual 1 every six months.  Glad I went elsewhere and saved a lot of money as well as time and frustration.  Definitely go elsewhere."
445,"Avoid if you can. I walked in on a Saturday and and made an appointment for the following weekend. I asked the girl at the counter if they wanted to take my insurance as I was digging in my purse to get it and she said no they will take it during my appointment. Felt a little rushed but left and came back the following weekend anyways. 

Appointment comes around and I give them the insurance info, and the lady is telling me they can't pull my insurance up online and they can't call to confirm bc it's the weekend. I pull up my account online showing all my benefits but apparently they couldn't do anything with that. Annoying. So I have to make another appointment for the following week. The girl says she will call Monday and get it all sorted ok. At this point I wanted to try another place but this is the only place nearby with Saturday hours.

Tuesday rolls around and I get a call from the receptionists asking for the last 4 of my social so they can confirm my insurance. (did I not just give that info on Saturday?) I give it to her anyways and she says she will call Thursday and confirm everything (what happened to confirming on Monday?) 

Thursday rolls around and I decided to call them bc I had to take the day off work and wanted to get it over with. I ask the receptionist if they confirmed my insurance yet and she pauses and says she will do and call me back. She did and I went in later that day. The exam was actually quick and the optometrist was nice. Cool. They didn't have my preferred contact brand in and gave me these cheap contacts that burned and irritated my eyes. Then it comes to check out time and the girl still can't figure out my insurance! She calls verifies everything over the phone and still can't figure it out. I think it was the end of her shift so she left and let someone else take over. This person then has to call the insurance again and confirm again. (Why? I have no clue either) It's over 45 minutes at this point of trying to get this sorted and then she tells me the insurance company doesn't like to give out info to out of network providers. No one mentioned this before, so now instead of paying $10 copay it was $44. She apologizes which is nice but doesn't help at this point. I told her not to even worry about ordering the contacts and just paid the copay and left. I have never, in the over 15 years I've been getting eye exams had an experience so frustrating. Never again."
446,"I stopped going here when I was informed if I chose to not follow a doctors opinion I had to sign a document stating so in order to continue being a patient. I disagreed with what I was asked and it is my right to do so. However the doctor was more concerned with ensuring that they did not get sued than listening to me. 

Never again."
447,"I have only been here one other time and both times have been horrendous. But I'm just going to talk about the situation that went down right now. This morning I woke up with terrible back pain. Not sore muscle but maybe kidney stones or something... I puked over 6 times, can't lay on my back, could not keep any water down and decided wow I'm going to go to the urgent care because I feel like I'm going to die. This doctor was a joke. I hate to be mean but I clearly stated all of my symptoms and all he did was say it was a strained muscle. He prescribed me children's Tylenol (I'm 20) and told me to sleep. I get that it's an urgent care but I feel like I did not get the proper tests done whatesoever. I even threw up in the waiting room and they were like naw fam ur chill go home????? After he left we asked to talk to him again because I thought maybe I wasn't explaining everything right and he basically told me I was wrong and left. Never again. I'd rather wait the 3 hours in the ER."
448,"*Update* This place of business has aggressively asked me to remove this review. They provided ""notes"" stating that the correct injectable was used. I'm not a medical expert so I can't speak on the authenticity of the ""note"". 
I was treated so poorly after writing this review and harassed by the the lady who replied. She sent me a very ugly private message. This was a legitimate mess up on their behalf and I have yet to receive a phone call or a sincere apology. I wish I would've never gone to this place to begin with. Lesson learned. 

*Original review*
I am so upset with this place. Last year I purchased a Groupon specifically for Xeomin, I went in and everything went fine. I recently logged into their member portal and it states the injectables that were used on me were Dysport. How are you going to charge someone the Xeomin price and have the nerve to switch the injection without their consent! Wow 
Never Again. Shady business."

450,"I have used the urgent care and several specialists numerous times over the last few years but never again. I have left Harvard Vanguard entirely because I am a plus sized woman and I have experienced a very overt size bias at this practice.  On the most memorable occasion, I mentioned to the doctor that I appreciated that they had larger smocks than most places, and she said, ""Yes my normal patients appreciate that too.""  I do not want to give my business to a corporate culture that discriminates.  Go someplace else."
451,"You know, when you are new and town and looking for a dentist, I really hate it when dentists try to scam you. That happened here. I get my teeth cleaned every 6 months. I am new to town. I would know if some major drama happened since the last 6 months. There would have been a warning. I was told by the first dentist I saw, not DR. TIFFANY PAIVA, but another one that I needed 3 crowns. I was like, ya, I might need one but 3 I don't think so. So I came here for a second opinion. And you know what? Not only did she say I needed 3 crowns but she said I needed deep cleaning treatments that are very expensive every 3 weeks for months. So I went back to the first dentist and he said, that part is not true. I still didn't think 3 crowns was necessary. Nice to have but not actually necessary as I have no issues. So I got a 3rd opinion. Guess what, still no deep cleaning at all required and 1 crown. And I could wait a year or two on that. So there you go. Great degree, young doctor, expensive franchise, hustle. Be weary as the deep cleaning was completely untrue verified by 2 other dentists."
452,"I've been going to New England Eye for a number of years, due to the convenient location and well-appointed eyewear dispensary, but my most recent experience has made me reconsider my loyalty to this place. In October 2012, I realized it had been two years since my last eye exam and decided it was time to book an appointment. Not something you take lightly, since appointments can take upwards of two hours with an optometry student at NEE. The appointment started with a conversation about my most recent complaints with my eyesight: too much time in front of a computer, fatigue, etc. What followed was different levels of tedium looking at eye charts, having my pupils dilated, and waiting for the doctor to confirm the findings. We discussed the new prescription which -according to the student- was very close to my existing one, which meant I could continue to use my old glasses interchangeably.  This is important, since the decision that followed (buying a brand new frame) hinged on my ability to continue wearing THREE frames with my old prescription without forking out a small fortune to change all of them.

Within a few days, I realized something was wrong with my prescription. I was having a hard time adjusting to the new glasses, and every time I called to complain about them, I was told to give it a few more days. During these conversations, I took the opportunity to also express concern about having to pay for any updates to the prescription -not so much for the new pair, because I figured they would adjust it as needed, but for the old ones. In the end, the gentleman told me there was nothing they could do for my old pairs if a new prescription was required, but he told me to come back for a check-up of my prescription.  In other words, my dislike of contact lenses and my decision to purchase a new pair -based on their intern's ill advice- was going to hurt my wallet twice as much.  As suggested, I called up the doctor who told me to contact the front desk to schedule an Rx revision appointment, which should take no more than an hour.

My first mistake was thinking the appointment would take an hour. The second was thinking that I could kill two birds with one stone: dental work at the BU office downstairs, and a quick eye exam upstairs. Not true. By the time the second hour of my Rx revision appointment was over, the Novocaine was wearing off, it was 2pm, and I was so hungry I could eat a small child. At some point, the intern announced she had discovered the problem with my Rx. She left and came back to tell me we needed to check for myopia, too, because the corrections to my distance vision could have been masking other problems. So, for the first time ever at this office, I was asked to read from a chart up close, and thus my myopia was discovered. Presumably, the legacy of a lot of reading, too much time in front of a computer and turning 40 (that stung!). The intern left me in the room for what seemed like another hour -more like 15 minutes, in all honesty, but long enough for my frustration to come up in a stream of tears. She got me some water and went to get the doctor, but my tears must have freaked her out since she stayed away until the doctor was ready to come in (another 15-20 minutes). Of course, their neglecting me only made me angrier and more frustrated. The doc tried, but did not help much. I could not even speak, and all I managed to get was a new prescription, a revision of the new glasses and a promise to fix one of my old pairs (because the doc did not see the other frames sitting next to my chart).

The saving grace in this ordeal is Vitelio at the eyewear dispensary who promised to fix my lenses in a flash (it was Friday), and the new prescription was ready by Monday. He's always been super friendly and attentive, unlike some of his colleagues.

You would expect this story to wrap up soon, but you would be wrong.  I told the woman at the dispensary who gave me the glasses (Vitelio was gone for the day) that things looked weird at a distance; specifically, all the letters had halos around them.  She told me to give it a try for a few days. I have been wearing this new prescription since Monday (today is Friday), and it is still not right. I have confirmed that my uncorrected distance vision is far better than with these glasses, which seem to exacerbate my astigmatism. Last night, I could not read the MBTA announcements on the platform, but could see them clearly when taking of the glasses. Mind you, my prescription is tiny, and I can manage sans eyewear, but it still requires correction.  

Come Monday, I will have to call them again to schedule another appointment. I am terrified about the prospect, and cannot afford to waste another two hours locked in a little room at NEE. Unfortunately, I can't afford to go elsewhere, or I would find another doctor pronto.

I applaud teaching facilities, but this type of customer service is unacceptable anywhere."
453,"I just had Bladeless Lasik performed on both my eyes yesterday. The actual surgery and experience immediately afterward was much smoother than I expected. 
In preparation for the surgery, I visited TLC Waltham 2 times. The first for an assessment, and once more for a pre-op check. Both times the staff were very prompt and friendly. Dr. Lin Chia and Jim Bulter were very helpful at explaining everything I was to expect during the procedure and how to prepare. Overall, the TLC staff gave me thoughtful, personalized care even though I know they see a large amount of patients.
The surgery itself is an odd enough experience that it was a little scary at the beginning, like taking an airplane for the first time. But Dr. Villazon and Jim were talking to me the whole time, which really calmed me down. During the surgery, which only take a few minutes altogether, I felt no pain at all. There was pressure from the way they hold your eye open, which is a weird feeling but more from it being so out of the ordinary. 
Afterwards I ate a pizza and fell asleep for 8 hours. During that time, I didn't want to open my eyes because everything seemed very bright, and my eyes felt like there was dust in them, but I had no real pain.
As of my post op meeting this morning, everything is healing smoothly and I see better than with my contacts or glasses. I agree with the other reviewers that if you can afford it, I would strongly recommend it."
454,I saw Dr. Beckley seeking a second opinion. My medical history following several previous surgeries was complex. Dr. Beckley identified the issues and a positive outcome was achieved. His empathetic skill was exceptional. I would recommend Dr. Beckley and will come from out of state to see him if looking for a surgical consultation.
455,"For patients who are unable to advocate for themselves, Kaiser is a nightmare. They failed to cancel a low-income member's policy even though they had a written request, and then took the monthly premium and now won't give it back for 6-8 weeks--bounced checks, anyone? They still wouldn't have cancelled it, and would still be charging the member if advocates hadn't intervened.  Also, even though Kaiser received multiple requests for records through every channel for the member's records so that the member can be evaluated for services and receive care, they have failed to provide those records. A request made 5 months ago still isn't filled. If the first rule of medicine is ""do no harm"" then Kaiser is failing in a big way-- not because of their doctors but because of their management."
456,"Both my 5 year old son and I have had to use TX Orthopedics on separate occasions for broken arms. My son received care from Dr. Hardy and recovered great after only a couple weeks in a hard cast. They also made my sons summer much better, despite the broken arm, when we called spontaneously to come in and get a water proof cast changed out for a vacay.
 
I received care more recently from Dr. Kilbride who ended up having to operate on my broken arm. I was extremely nervous about having surgery but he did a phenomenal job and the surgery/recovery itself has not been half as bad as I was expecting. We appreciate the care we've received from Texas Orthopedics and highly recommend them to those in need."
457,"I work for this hospital and I would give it 0 stars if I could. GO SOMEWHERE ELSE!!  I would suggest going to Exempla in Lafayette.  They are friendly and competent.

1.  BCH hires the people that will take the least amount of money.  This is usually people with no experience.  The turn over rate is high because experienced staff is ALWAYS training.  And if that was not bad enough, they still have to do their regular job.  Do they get compensated for their troubles.  Maybe .10 an hour.

2.  BCH will only make improvements if it does not effect their bottom line.  Have no illusions - this is a business.  They will do as many tests on you as they can to jack up the price.  BCH motto is - they are customers/clients not patients, this isn't patient care it is customer service!  And you are getting serviced, just not in a good way.

3.  Management does not care about patient complaints.  All it does is give them the nerve to come after experienced staff and tell us that we are not working hard enough.  Which in turn makes us bitter and we either quit or just ride it out until something better comes along.

4.  Besides my personal experience of getting fleeced by this hospital, I have spoken to numerous patients who have had their health extremely compromised due to the inadequate care that this hospital provides.  People have lost limbs to infection and MRSA to name a few.  Mine was a missed diagnosis which resulted in unnecessary pain and a slower recovery time.

Again, I would suggest going to Exempla in Lafayette.  I have had the pleasure of going there and the staff is awesome.  I am keeping this post generic because I still work there but as I stated before, I am simply waiting for something better to come along."
458,"Received a promotion in the mail for 59$ X-ray & Cleaning, and made a terrible mistake booking an appointment. 45Minutes of the dental hygienist taking X-rays and pictures of my mouth, normal small talk, then the Doctor who right off the bat feels like  a con artist walks in the room, tells a few bad jokes and the explains what is happening inside my mouth. The dental hygienist had already filled me in on my current ""active infection"" occurring in my mouth call Periodontal Disease. Sounds really bad right, well these two are trying to convince me that I have active bacteria eating away at the bone in my teeth. They show me the measurements and the entire time I'm kind of skeptical. So the doctor leaves the room and I'm sitting there and I ask the dental hygienist can she clean my teeth and she says NO I can't you have an active infection you'll get your teeth cleaned when you come back for a deep cleaning. I'm like okay? I guess? Then the dental hygienist leaves the room and the sales lady comes in and shows me a paper with a 1,180.00$ total to have this ""deep cleaning"" done! I'm like a wait a second here, y'all got this wrong I came here to get my teeth cleaned for 59$! Not to fall for you dumb and backwards scam that leaves their patients wheeled out in a wheel chair all drugged up for a most likely non necessary procedure! Scam Scam Scam felt like I was getting set up to be scammed by this dentist office! I've been to the dentist a lot in my life but never to one like this! The Dental hygienist did end up cleaning my teeth but not very well! She was done in 10 minutes & no fluoride or anything! Very poor experience 

I suggest you learn from my mistake and go somewhere else!"
459,"This place has the most abyssmal customer service I have ever encountered at a for-profit business. We were trying to get pregnant on a somewhat restricted schedule as my husband and I live and work overseas. We did our initial consultation with Dr. Denis in his office, then set up phone consults leading up to the proceedure. Despite emailing and telling the admin staff several times that we lived several time zones away - they kept wanting to schedule us for appointments at ridiculous times for us. So okay - that could be forgiven - I'm sure they deal with lots of people. Then it was quite clear that despite us practically RUNNING after them trying to get them to communicate with us in the lead up to the procedures, all they were wanting to ensure was the payment. Wouldn't even schedule our procedures until EVERYTHING was paid in advance. And this had to be done over the phone while transiting international airports!

So then we arrive in ATL for our cycle and suddenly they want to see us at the drop of a hat even though our house is about an hour's drive from their offices. We had been trying to get a schedule for all of our appointments lined up before leaving for the US - but again - all they cared about was the $$$. We barely saw Dr. Denis after the initial consultation  constantly just shuffled from nurse to nurse to other doctors. The worst insult was during my egg retrieval (which was being done by the 3rd or 4th Doc I'd seen in the cycle) - the tall slender woman came to the recovery room and informed me the results were bad with absolutely NO empathy or bedside manner. The next person who was wheeled into the room after me had the same doctor go right to her and tell her the great results of her procedure and it couldn't have been more night and day in the doctor-patient interaction. While I'm happy for the other lady - at that particular moment a bit of privacy and tact on the doctor's behalf would have gone a LONG way. 

The final straw however, was our experience when we decided to try a 2nd time... We paid all our money up front (didn't want the same scheduling fiasco as the first time!) and were told someone would be in contact. 36 days later I emailed and told the finance people that no one had called. They assured me someone would get in touch with me soon. At that point I made up my mind I didn't want to have the same horrible, impersonal service I had the second time while spending so much money to line the doctors' pockets. And to close this story with a slamming of the door - when I emailed Dr. Denis' nurse for his email address so I could write him a note describing our experiences in the hopes that others didn't have to endure what we had - I was informed WE'RE NOT ALLOWED TO TALK DIRECTLY TO THE DOCTORS THEMSELVES but she'd pass on a message. Are you kidding me?!?!? That kind of a response was why I wanted to email him directly! 

Bottom line - you have to chase them until it's time for the proceedure - then they're rude and inconsiderate of your time - expecting you to drop everything and be at previously unscheduled meetings in an hour. The doctors and admin staff are pretty rude. All they care about is getting the money, but when you want a detailed accounting of what you've paid and any refund you may be owed... It's absolute radio silence. I don't know who we'll use for our 2nd round - but it won't be ACRM!"
460,"I highly recommend Dr. Kraus for Eczema. My husband had been going to him for a couple of years and had received great results. We had our son about 10 months ago and when he turned around 3 months he started with Eczema really bad. His pediatrician prescribed a standard oil for him and had us use washes/lotions for sensitive skin & without fragrances; however, it wasn't working. Around 6 months old, he was still wearing the baby mitts to keep him from scratching as the Eczema was still bad. We were trying everything until my mother kept saying we needed to take him to a dermatologist. My husband suggested Dr. Kraus as that's who he went to; so we called and they start taking babies at the 6 month mark, which was exactly how old our son was. I took him for the appointment he looked him over and automatically knew what he needed. He prescribed a custom body wash, body oil and ointment which was made from custom compounds according to each patient's specific needs. I got the prescription filled, the cost was expensive about $160 for all 3 items, and of course insurance didn't cover it, which I don't know why, especially for a baby as it's a necessity not just cosmetic. I started using it on my son the next day and within 2 days his eczema was all cleared up - it worked wonders! Since that day he has not scratched nor has he had any flair ups. It's amazing how the combination of the body wash, oil and ointment worked so well and that out weighs the cost. My son is a different baby now! We continue to use the wash and oil daily, but the ointment not as frequent and only really when needed for when his skin gets irritated. Dr. Kraus is amazing and if you have a child suffering from eczema don't hesitate to go see him, I promise it will be worth it."
461,"I am amazed after all these reviews they haven't changed their ways! I called on the phone and had such an awful experience, I literally asked her: do you NOT want me as a patient bc you are making this very difficult! Tracey was her name and she was horrendous! 
I actually sought an alternative."
462,"I cannot speak highly enough of this establishment!! It's a dream; Magical and amazing in every way! The staff is more than kind, considerate, thoughtful, patient, and knowledgeable. All their products are high quality and low price, with daily specials so epic that they stand alone in affordability. Overall, the quality of this dispensary reins above all in every way."
463,",Waste of time. 
First, I didn't even get to see the doctor.
 The nurse Christine Haboush, asked if I'd gone a orthopedic doctor for my neck pain a nerve pain.... tied to send me to one as well?
Guess she didn't look at my history at all...
I said  yes.
 I've been seen by and I'm being see by 4 surgeons. One, being world renowned. the Other three are getting well know as well and they all said I needed to see a neurosurgeon asap! 
Then tried to push me into their system of doctors and Pain clinic. 
When I said ""no, I like my pain clinic"" she said ""that's all she can do"". 
I said ""ok, and that I needed the PT but not the pain Clinic"", she again said that's all she can do, over and over.... That's how It ended, never gave me pt or anything. More less tried to kick me out as I was leaving.
I've had nerve pain down my arms and a nerve going over my ear that's been killing me for years. Now I can't turn my head or look down with out pain in my neck and going down my arms. 
I waited 3mo to see a nurse, that just read me my MRI report back to me more less...."

Update!
Less then a week later, I get Diagnosed with thoracic outlet....
It wasn't hard to find, I don't have a pulse in either of my arms... 

I told her I had TOS and she wouldn't even test me, didn't take my bold pressure or check for a plus. All she did was look at the MIR and the nerve test. (witch can show nothing, even if you have it) She said don't believe what you read on line.... 

Guess she should've at least taken my pulse and do test to TOS."
465,My husband has had glute pain for over 2 years.  Nothing has helped.  He was to the point of another band-aid treatment suggestion of spinal shots...until now.  He is not experiencing any pain!  He was having pain of 8-10 on a scale if 1-10.  Pacific Neuro Therapy has helped make the pain go away by working the muscle involved!  The machine they use is intensely awesome!  The 3 guys doing the treatments work great together and know where to work on you.  My husband was back to running pain free before the 10 main treatments were finished...and is continuing to do so!  Would recommend this company to any one!  Good job guys!
466,"I first went to 19th Street Dental because it was recommended to me by someone I trust who had a great experience and after reading the reviews here on yelp. Dr. Zeineddin was recommended so I decided to give them a try. I had my first app late 2017 where everything went according to plan. The problem started on my next app. I needed to get more fillings done, one being on tooth 18 where an old mercury filling needed to be removed first. The other filling was in tooth 14. And a few others. Once the procedure was done I informed the dentist that my bite was off and was told it was likely due to me just being numb. No biggie till I got home and with full feeling returned realized the teeth on the left side in front of the fillings were no longer connecting when I bit down because the tooth had been overfilled but I was due for a bit more work so no biggie. That same day I decided to go for Invisalign and signed up for a credit card that they recommended to finance the charges and was charged in full that day and told my trays would be in in about 2 weeks. Anyway, I began to eat a breakfast because I asked could I resume eating normally after the numbness wore off and was told yes. I was able to chew my food 3x before tooth 18 cracked and I started having discomfort in tooth 14. Horrible pain in tooth 18. The office had closed for the holiday so I was left to deal with the pain till the new year. Got back into the dentist chair and find out that the removal of the old filling cause structural compromise but that could be remedied with a crown. Understandable. Asked about Invisalign and was told they were probably backed up due to the holiday, just give it another 2 weeks. Set another appointment and got the crown done. Once again was told I could resume my regular diet once the numbness wore off. Took one bite of a Larabar and there's the pain again. I immediately felt it again. I called the dentist to inform her that the crown didn't work. She apologized for my discomfort then advised me that I should've started with soft foods and worked firmer foods back into my diet slowly. To me that made no sense. So I make another app and she informs me that the crack in my tooth must've been lower than she could initially could see and that a root canal is now needed and I have to pay yet again for work to be done on the same tooth. And she examines tooth 14 and says she doesn't see anything wrong. Again still no Invisalign. I'm told ""oh give it two more weeks"". So I inform her that I don't feel I should have to pay a 3rd time to fix pain I didn't have before she did this work. That's when the waiting game started. She said ""let's give it another week and see how it feels"". Ok. This went on for a month. Mind you, at this point, I haven't eaten on the left side of my mouth now for almost 3 months. Minor adjustments had been made to the crown, all charged to my insurance, leading to no relief. Basically, it became a game of we will wait this out until you're ready to pay for it. Each time I'd come back and each time I'd hear ""let's give it another week"". Then I was informed that my Invisalign hadn't come in because the order kept being rejected by the dentist because she didn't like the plan submitted. Never bothered to inform me even though my credit card was already charged. So due to this crown issue I ended up canceling the entire order for the trays. On my last visit I mentioned again that tooth 14 was giving me problems when I chew and she decided to take one of her instruments and tap on tooth 14 and tooth 15. Because the tapping brought more sensitivity to tooth 15 than 14 she felt that was vérification of her not seeing a problem with the tooth, though I was clearly telling her what I was feeling. She then proceeded to tell me that my physical therapy was likely the cause of the tooth discomfort even though my discomfort was before my PT. So, eating firm foods too soon, bite was off because of numbness but persisted for months and PT caused my other tooth pain when chewing. None of it was due to the work she'd done. Anyway, not wanting to have tooth pain and tired of only chewing on my right side I wrote her expressing my displeasure and asking that she fix her work if I am to continue being a patient there. She responded with some suggestions of possible removing the crown and recommending a specialist but after further examination it was clear a root canal would be needed. So, she adjusted the crown again to where it's not touching flush with any teeth above it to minimize the pain but also causes food between the teeth to not be chewed completely. For numbing me. Afterward she emailed me a proposal for a root canal to fix the pain and the charge would be $700+ out of pocket after insurance. The total bills just for this one tooth, tooth 18, would have been well over $2k out of pocket with insurance. So here I sit still looking for a dentist to fix what she messed up."
467,"I saw James Frank for retinal tears. He treated them with laser to prevent further tearing. I was pleased with this part of my experience. On follow up visits, he couldn't provide me with any sort of explanation for my loss of peripheral vision though. When he found out that I had sought a second opinion, his whole demeanor changed. When I brought that concern up, he assured me that it didn't offend him at all. But when I recently requested a visit, his secretary called back and said I should see one of the other doctors that I had visited. Since I had seen other doctors, I should follow up with them instead, ""it would just be better for everyone involved"". 
I'm not sure why it offended his pride so bad that I had sought a second opinion? I thought second opinions were pretty standard practice, especially concerning something as serious as your vision. 
If you do happen to see him, don't batter his fragile ego by mentioning another doctor."
468,"I was incredibly nervous going in, but I am happy to say the results exceeded my wildest expectations and most certainly the best $5k I spent ever!!  My only regret was not doing the procedure sooner!!

I went in for the consultation on 3/9.  TLC staff was very helpful in answering all of my questions and thoroughly explaining the procedure to me.  Once they confirmed that I was a candidate for LASIK I was able to schedule time for the surgery right away on 3/19.  Due to the short time until the surgery date they were able to do pre-op exam at the same appointment (which I understand you would usually need another appointment for this exam). 

Again on the day of surgery the TLC staff was very helpful at making sure I know exactly what to expect every step of the way.  The procedure itself was very quick, less than 20 mins.  Afterwards my eyes were a little blurry and tearing a lot but not much pain.  I arrived home at about 8PM and went to sleep right away, the next morning I woke up with perfect eye sight and really no pain or grittiness, just a little dryness (kind of like when you fell asleep with contacts in).  The drops help a lot with the dryness and feels great if you  keep them in the fridge (great advise from Jim!!)

The TLC team provided great support throughout the entire process.  The hardest part for me was certainly the uncertainty beforehand, but the entire team has done great to keep me informed and putting my mind at ease."
469,Had an awful issue with my insurance company not paying for a procedure.  Michele Pickett at Oregon Clinic was an awesome patient advocate and would not give up until the matter was resolved.  She ultimately was successful in getting my insurance company to pay the bill.  I will always use Oregon Clinic for this reason.  And the medical staff is awesome.
470,"I have never posted anything bad about a company. Ever....But I have to say My husband who has Crohns is at his wits end and so am I.  You make an appointment. You see the Doctor. He prescribes medicine to you that you absolutely need as the symptoms are so bad you can't stand yourself. After even asking the nurse 2 times are you going to call in the medicine....Yes we were told 2 times.  Today is a week after the appointment and there still is no prescription called in.  We have called and left numerous messages and keep checking in with our pharmacy with still nothing.  Who does this.  My husband is sick.....Does anyone care. Obviously these guys don't have it together and don't care.  If you can find somewhere else to go besides the location in Town Lake Woodstock I would advise you to do so.  These are suppose to be specialists.  I get more from my family doctor, at least he takes the time to speak to me. Be Aware."
471,"******BEWARE******
Do not use these people at all cost.

They are very unprofessional, demanding $800 up front from a customer less than 24 hours for a procedure that has been scheduled for weeks.

SHAME on you all for being LAZY and not working with my insurance company which pays 80% to you all but in return you demand 100% of the entire bill when the procedure has not even started.....YOUR ALL CROOKS.

I will post your names and all other demands.

I will ask my Dr. To find someone else and schedule me out further to avoid doing business with you crooks.

Claudia needs to be terminated from the position in which she currently holds and this business need to change the way they do business because the people are not going to put up with this nonsense."
472,"After 1st visit, I had to go elsewhere in the same week. Scheduled an appt to get teeth cleaned and they decided to take an entire hour to X-ray on a machine manufactured in 1988 and write up a bill for a 2nd visit for $212 just to clean my teeth - no cavities reported! I took my business elsewhere and got new X-rays (D.A.D. Could not send my X-rays, only a lousy screenshot) and cleaning done with my insurance covering 100%. This place will push products even after you've stated you're not interested. It's a waste of time and I have a sore in my mouth from the lady that crammed the X-ray tool into my mouth and took additional X-rays of the same spot because she ""couldn't get a good picture"". They're greedy and negligent. If you don't mind the drive for a fantastic dentist, check out Dr. Kimmerling in Marietta, GA!"
473,"If I could give them no stars I would. I have never received such bad care anywhere. I went for an ultrasound where they found extensive blood clots in my leg. The radiologist informed me that I needed a procedure to break up the clots and that would be performed that afternoon. He said they were going to admit me right then and he would see me in a few hours. The radiology tech wheeled me down to the registration desk and didn't leave the front desk worker any instructions. Since she didn't know what was happening she wheeled me down to the ER, even after I told her the radiologist told me I would not be admitted through the ER. After sitting in a bed in the hallway in the ER they moved me to a holding wing. At this point I still hadn't seen a doctor to tell me what was happening. We kept asking when my procedure was going to take place and no one could even tell me anything about that or my diagnosis. After 8 hours in the ER they finally found me a bed. When they got me up to my room my nurse still didn't know anything about the procedure or anything about my care. I was told in the ER that I wasn't allowed to eat or drink anything after midnight but I was given water and snacks overnight with medicine as the nurse stated there were no orders in my chart otherwise. At 7:00am a lab tech came in to take 12 viles of blood, only when i questioned her what they were for did the doctor come in and say that I was heading down for y procedure. At this point we still had no idea what the procedure entailed. She then stated that the reason that I didn't have the procedure yesterday was because the radiology tech misplaced me. After having the three hour procedure they wheeled me back to my room where they then informed me that because my insurance was not covered by the hospital that they would have to transfer me to Seton. This was at 1:00 as I was still coming out of sedation. After speaking with many hospital representatives they told me that I was going to be transferred between 5-7 that night. They were just waiting to speak to a doctor at seton to brief them about my condition. When my nurse came in a few minutes later and I asked him a few questions regarding my transfer and he became very angry and annoyed that I was having him repeat what they hospital representative just said except he didn't even allow me to ask my questions so he wouldn't know that.  So then we waited and waited and waited for my transport.  At 11:00 the transport finally arrived. Let me remind you that I was told I would be transported between 5 and 7. Well the ambulance driver said they weren't even called until 9:00 and had to come from Bastrop. What part about transporting a patient at 11:00  after they had a three hour procedure is in the best interest of the patient? Then apparently the nurse Marco who I had made mad earlier decided he wasn't going to fill out the proper paperwork which delayed us another hour. When I finally got to Seton the doctor told me that she had been waiting for me since 5. 

We then sent a letter to them telling them our displeasure with the care I received, I received a letter from Bonnie Melde that stated they were going to conduct interviews with all the parties, but she failed to even call the patient How can you get the real story without even talking to the patient who lived through it. After finally placing two calls to her office she finally called me back and argued with me through the whole conversation. She is in no place to tell me what kind of care I received because she wasn't there. The whole letter was complete lies and she didn't even care to hear it. The letter stated they were giving me a  25% off of my bill out of courtesy. She said she didn't even have to do that. 

So in conclusion DO NOT got to St Davids and if you do and receive bad care don't expect them to listen or to care."
474,"Echoing what others have said in their reviews. I had a mixed feeling choosing dr. Lori as my primary physician reading the negative reviews in Yelp, but I gave it a try anyway. After my second visit, I realized what others said are pretty accurate. Dr. Lori was attentive but somehow I felt rushed so I didn't get to ask all questions I have. Front desk was very friendly but filling the paperwork was tedious. A lot of repetitive questions and I see why a lot of people say the process is inefficient. What threw me off, really, was the assitant. Yes I am talking about the one who wears layers of fake eyelashes. She was very rude! I had additional questions for dr. Lori but she looked annoyed ""I have another patient coming so you have to be out now"" When I insisted I have question aboiut my health, she replied ""What question, I can answer!"" 
I mean excuse me? Who are you? She even took my blood test results and tried to explain the results to me? That's not really the question I have. I felt very annoyed that she treated me this way."
475,"I have had several doctors in this hospital, half were pleasant, and half were quite scary. 

Dr.Erben is one of the most caring doctors I've ever met in my life Dr.Lerner is so intelligent and really takes the time to read my medical history and following up.  

I don't give Leslie Grady a good rating. She is very fake and does the bare minimum. She was often trying to not let me get tests I needed. Sure enough I was positive on all the tests that she was trying to talk me out of taking. 

Heather Hoffmeyer was extremely condescending and definitely comes off as the type who likes to cut corners as much as possible. She doesn't provide alternatives or make the patient feel like part of the process at all. She has a snobby attitude and often laughs at you when you ask questions. She often answers questions in a very roundabout way. Overall she is just a very cold person who does not make me feel comfortable at all."
476,"Went to visit dr. Hall her staff is appalling. It only leads me to QUESTION her professionalism!!! 

Secretarial staff lacks the articulation!!  Unable to give you proper direction to the building for which they work  (including any surrounding landmarks)..... clearly driving in from Outer parameters and unfamiliar with where they work or the surrounding areas of _SHAME!!

Ms. or MRS.Dr. Hall  Her Staff is threatening! RUDE and LIE!! 
 @ 10:29 I called and followed the RUDE BLONDE/GREY(OLD gal) directions.... when I pulled up in front of community @10:44am to inform I was there and to clearify what unit they were in... they wanted me to reschedule.... MY APPOINTMENT was @ 10:45 (traveled in from Cali for it) 

 The dits answering the call (same old gal) told me their office was full of patients....
when I walked in @ 10:46  Not a patient in her office..... NOT A ONE!!
 (guess they didn't anticipate my coming into the office) .... LIARS!!  SHAME!!! Shame on Dr.Hall for her staff..... AGAIN, MAKES YA QUESTION THE PROFESSIONALISM.

WHO WANTS TO SEE A DOCTOR WHO HAS A LYING STAFF?? MAKES YA WONDER ABOUT THEIR LEADER!! (well, unless your not a thinker and takes/puts trust in someone who doesn't clear exercise diligence, HONESTY and/nor professionalism.... IT'S ONLY YOUR LIFE!!!

I would suggest finding another INTERNIST / doctor and RUN LITERALLY FOR YOUR LIFE TO SOMEONE WHO HAS CARE!! Whose staff has care and respect and doesn't threaten when you ASK to talk to the Dr.  AS THEY DID IN FACT!!!!
  (Make like a good kid and when ya hear the playground bell,,, RUN FROM THE HALL!!)

Unfortunately, there is not a rating LESS than 1 star....... your life counts on this reading!!!
just saying....stay healthy!"
477,"Altamonte Springs Office.  Ms. Joann Rodriguez, aesthetician, Med Spa.  I had no idea where to go. There were only stairs. There were no signs pointing to the fact that you had to go up the stairs. I figured it out for myself and went upstairs. The door was locked. I called her on her cell.  She answered, this time, and told me the door was kept locked if she was there by herself, which she was.  She came to unlock the door and when I went in, there was a waiting room and a check-in desk, with no one there (keep in mind this was 3:30 in the afternoon; a time when you would think a dermatology office would be full of patients.) She positioned me in the waiting room and came to get me (not on time) for my microdermabrasion. I was led to a dark, cramped room with boxes stacked everywhere and an aesthetician's chair. I thought I was going to a ""spa."" Not exactly as advertised. I asked for the package of 6 microdermabrasions for $600.  Ms. Rodriguez proceeded.  I was a little uneasy.  However, after she completed the microdermabrasion, I wasn't still uneasy, until she handed me a list of dermatological products that were priced $75 and up that she recommended.  Still, it didn't keep me from making a 2nd appointment for May 7 (since I didn't know what was to come"".)

Before May 7, Ms. Rodriguez phoned me and told me she couldn't make that appointment. She had a family emergency.  I understood and we texted back and forth till I rescheduled my 2nd appointment for May 14. That microdermabrasion was just like the first, no difference. I made my 3rd appointment for June 21.

Now is when the real fun started. Sometime during the second week of May I called Ms. Rodriguez  because I couldn't remember when my next appointment was.  She said she'd call me when she got to the office. After not returning any of my many calls, I decided to text her on May 31.  I was concerned and I asked her if everything was OK since she hadn't called or texted me back. Her next response, a text said simply ""Hello, your next appointment is June 21 at 2:30.""  No explanations of why she hadn't returned my calls. I wasn't happy, but I let it go and thanked her. 

On June 21 I called and asked her for a phone number of Dr. Salinas.  I said ""See you at 2:30.""  First I got ""I'm not in the office and I cannot check what your appointment time is?"" ""When I am out of the office I do not carry a computer with me to look up or schedule patients."" ""There was no way for me to figure out what happened with the appointment unless I checked the system.  What kind of professional medical spa professional doesn't have her schedule on her phone, or home computer, especially when she has another office in Clermont, where she also lives. I sent her a copy of her own text giving me the appointment for June 21. 
 
  Her response was ""I see that but I have no idea what happened until I get to the office and look at the appointment scheduler. I know I have another patient scheduled I'm so sorry something got messed up."" Then ""I messed up on the date I gave you.  I have you scheduled for June 25."" That is when I had had enough.   I said I wanted my $400 back for the 4 remaining microdermabrasions, and to credit it back to my American Express (they are pursuing a separate dispute on this issue). Now, keep in mind, it's 1:24 on the day of my appointment. Didn't hear back from her till 2:42 p.m. and her text read ""OK I'm with a patient I'll be done today at 6:30 p.m."" To make a VERY long story shorter, she said she'd refund my money and she needed my credit card #.  I said no and she said she could send me a check.  I said no check. Finally I saw no other way to get my refund than call her with my #.  The next day she credited back $350 of the $400 I was owed. When I questioned why I didn't get back the full $400 she texted that me I had a package deal of 6 for $400 and if I was cancelling the last 4 I didn't get the quantity discount. At this time I told her I wanted back the entire $600 for all the aggravation she had caused  me. That's where we still are today.  DO NOT GO TO Ms. Rodriguez at the medical spa in Altamonte Springs or Clermont. It is very unprofessional and it's more like work. You are forewarned."
478,"I saw Dr Shung for several years before switching to a more convenient doctor. To address complaints in other yelp reviews:  she runs her office lean. It is her and her nurse. Her nurse does double (maybe triple) duty as nurse and reception. Other doctor offices run with 3-4 people. I don't fault Dr. Shung for running lean. Making money as a primary care physician is hard with our managed care setup in this country. She also doesn't always stay on schedule, but her patients ALWAYS get the time they need. Always. She listens. She obviously cares, but it is undoubtedly true that the way she does business creates inconvenience for her patients. If you are aware of this and patient enough, she's a good primary care physician. I personally wish she would make changes to address the delays, but I can't fault her for trying to both focus on patient care and make a decent living. She's a good doctor, and that counts for a lot. I've seen several and fired most of them for being perfunctory and not listening well. These doctors have different priorities. I like dr. Shung's priorities better. I didn't fire her. I just switched for convenience and now I'm with a doctor who draws a salary from a clinic that allots 30 minutes per patient. He can do this because he's semi-retired after a long career working in hospitals as a specialist. The clinic can do it because they are a large operation and make their profit through other services. But I do not expect an independent business owner doctor to be able to do the same and keep her practice open.  So know this going in and enjoy a quality experience in the exam room."
479,"Update:  I think Sheila cares. However, her approach to addressing my ever-changing strange symptoms was to send me to specialist after specialist who, one after one, told me nothing was wrong. She shunted me off to many specialists, but never the one I needed. It was a chiropractor -- a chiropractor-- who finally sent me to the right specialist who diagnosed me with a life-long condition. A chiropractor did what she and another doctor I saw couldn't. And I'm 2 years delayed in getting treatment.  Oh well. She did her best, i suppose.

480,"I initially posted a negative review because it was hard to find the Seton Northwest office, and I missed the appointment with Dr. Bledsoe I'd been anticipating for some months.  I had been told it would be four months before I could expect a rescheduled date. 

Since then, ARC has contacted me to schedule an earlier appointment, and I greatly appreciate it.  I just wish the assistance had been easier to come by, and not as a result of my leaving a neg.  Thanks, ARC, for taking care of this...I still think I'll still keep looking for another endo whose appointment system is a bit easier to wrangle."
481,"Not honest, tricky and slick.

We had quick need of a vapor cleaner.  We decided to come here instead of ordering, in order to buy local.

I spoke with the owner, Diane, on the phone at length. She seemed knowledgable, fair and reasonable.  She offered to sell us their ""demo cleaner, we only use it to demonstrate here in the store"" for the same price as a new one, but without having to wait on the order.  She said the new ones were out of stock at the distributor and we'd have to wait some time.  However, she said it has only been demonstrated just a few times in store and was like new.

We came in to look at it soon as we could get down there during store hours, which was 4 days later.  Less than waiting for stock to come in at the other place anyways.  When we came in she said it worked out great for them, as the distributor had enough stock that a dealer could get a demo, so they'd have a replacement really soon.

We looked at the demo they were offering, but it did not look like a demo.  I asked the owner if this would still have a warranty and she told me, ""we'll cover that"" and walked away.  The store was busy and the owner went to talk with a customer.  I asked a sales lady about it and she said, ""it's in great shape - we've only rented it out a few times"".  I said, ""it was your rental?"", she replied ""the one we rent for 70 to home owners, not professional cleaners"".   I asked about the bristles on the brushes... while the unit was very clean, the brushes were all crushed completely flat as if it had been in heavy service until the brushes had nothing left to give.  She didn't know, so I asked the owner.

I asked the owner about the brush replacements and she said that yes you could order them!  I asked how much were they, and she didn't know.  She looked at her computer, and said she wasn't sure.  I asked if the unit would be any cheaper since we would need to replace the brushes, and she offered to drop the price $50 (the unit is around $500).  It turns out we couldn't replace one of the brushes for that.

Since the distributor suddenly had stock again, we decided we would buy a new one.

The owner justified screwing us because 'we would get it immediately instead of waiting on back-order'.  There appeared to be no backorder, and a call to a national distributer had no backorder.

The owner told us it was just an in-store demo.  It was their rental.  She would sell it to us for not a penny less than a new one, until I pointed out that the bristles were utterly horizontal and so stiff as to be inflexible.

The owner said ""they would take care of the warranty"" and walked off, and then dodged the question when I brought it back up.  Are you a woman of your word or not?  With our new one we learned the actual warranty is utterly non-transferrable and after warranty expires they charge high rates for repairs.

The owner dillied and dallied over the useless brushes and gave us a discount not nearly enough to replace them.


We felt extremely bait-and-switched and that if we had ordered we would have had one only a few days after visiting in store... instead we didn't get to order one for a few days after visiting the store (because it was Friday evening) and our wait was needlessly extended.

I understand the need to make a profit - we all have this need.  But to make it off the back of someone else through dishonesty or trickery is wrong.

I felt highly deceived by this business, they lied to us and tried to take us to the cleaners - if I hadn't thoroughly investigated the cleaner and asked pointed questions I'd have gotten screwed like only a used car dealer can shaft you.

If you go there I recommend you bring your senses and caution."
482,"TL; DR - Balloon sinuplasty is amazing and has improved my life immeasurably. Get the surgery!

I've never been the healthiest person when it came to my sinuses but I never had allergies until I moved to Austin.  Every year they got a little worse, but 3 years ago after I had my daughter they were making my life miserable. I was always sick, sinus infections, bronchitis, general viral ick, swollen eyes. I came here a little over a year ago and started taking the drops. Around February I hadn't noticed any improvements and had visited 2 different ENTs for my sinus issues. One said ""you're just someone who gets sick a lot, sorry, antibiotics are just your life"". The other said ""well you don't seem to have any polyps so I don't know what to tell you.""  And when I say I was sick, I mean, SICK. Coughing all night long to the point it was triggering asthma attacks. Going days or weeks without sleep. Horrible coughing fits on all my work calls and everyone was like ""good god, are you dying? You sound horrible."" Nothing was working, nothing helped.  My primary care doc refused to prescribe anything harder than OTC meds.  ""It's just a cold, you'll be fine."" IT'S NOT F'ING FINE.

I was at my wits end when I came in for allergy retesting and decided to switch to shots.  They realized I was about to lose my marbles (and I'd decided if I couldn't get things under control we'd have to move out of state) and offered to do a CT scan. Which led to them recommending the balloon sinuplasty, along with shaving down my septum and some other thing involving a steroid I think. I dunno, I was too tired but signed up with just the hope if it could help just a tiny bit it would be worth it.

The recovery suuuuuuuuucked. I think I would have bounced back from just the balloon portion quick but that septum surgery was no joke. I cried, it hurt and then suddenly... OXYGEN. I wasn't sick. I wasn't coughing. I wasn't stuffy. For the first time in my life (literally, I'm not even kidding) I could breathe. Is this how everyone else lives? OMG THIS IS AMAZING!!

It's been 3 months since my surgery and it has literally changed my life. I've never been able to exercise despite my efforts to start a workout plan constantly since I'd always wind up sick a week or two later, but I've been able to run outside for the last 6 weeks. I haven't been sick since and I can sleep through the night again. My skin looks better, the dark circles under my eyes have improved and I feel like a new person. I honestly can't thank these guys enough for giving me the relief no one else has, I only wish I'd done it sooner. If you're at the end of the rope, DO IT!  

Also, the shots seem to be helping (or maybe it's just the surgery results) but I've only had to take an allergy pill once every week or two instead of every day. I'm looking forward to a totally congestion free life soon!"
483,"Our experience here was horrific. We'd just relocated from CO and we needed to have our son seen by a pediatrician a.s.a.p. for his 2 month well baby check-up. Not having enough time to set up interviews with pediatric practices, I chose this office because of the great online reviews and Hermann's stated holistic approach. We arrived to the office, which was very stuffy and uncomfortable for me, although the environment may be quite inviting for children. Once in the exam room, Hermann came in, introduced herself, and everything was okay. She seemed a bit a spacey, but that wasn't a big deal. As she was examining our son, she noticed that he had a penile adhesion, something that neither my husband nor I had ever heard of. She proceeded to pull apart the adhesion as our son lie there screaming. She tried to assuage our horror and discomfort by stating that he was crying because of her cold hands, so she's an unhesitant liar. We trusted that she was doing this procedure because it needed to be done, and didn't stop her, but once we left I researched penile adhesions and quickly learned that what she had done was completely unnecessary and not currently recommended by most medical practices. 

Her behavior was completely unprofessional. I recommend that parents go elsewhere. It seems that a lot of people are happy with her service, but, for us, she's a repulsive member of the medical community."
484,"While my actual general practitioner is very good and easy to get into most of the time, my neurologist is extremely hard to get into, and most of the time is unavailable.  My neurologist didn't have the professionalism, courtesy or respect for me to call and talk to me about my current MRI results.  Instead I received a call from her medical assistant who was rude and uncaring.  I'm not even sure if it is legal for a medical assistant to release that kind of information, I thought it had to come from the Doctor?  I feel like a number to them, since they are more of an HMO now more than ever before.  I can't wait to change service providers.  

Kaiser you are not good at customer service, I am tired of the lack of respect from everyone there.  Quite trying to throw drugs at me and try and treat my symptoms."
485,"I wouldn't let there people treat a stray dog . 
They have left me in 7-8 pain for weeks.
I will File Suite  & Win They are useless ! 
They gave me My Brother's Chart Mismanaged From the top to bottom.
They are useless ! Don't Bring anyone to them!"
486,"My husband never gets sick or cries but today he felt worse than he's ever felt so I took him to the nearest place, Texas Med Clinic. Bad idea. It was a 2 hour wait to be seen by a doctor, even though there was only one other person in the lobby. No big deal, I understand we were a walk-in. 

But after a while I start to worry as my husband was throwing up so much we ran out of bags. Literally throwing up every five mins for hours. The nurses offered him a shot and an IV while we are waiting, I said yes my husband said no. After more throwing up my husband finally agreed to a shot. After some more time he starts shaking. I look for a nurse or someone and finally get ahold of a male doctor who basically said this is not a hospital and you'll have more options in an ER. So I proceed to tell them to please call me an ambulance as my husband is STILL NONSTOP THROWING UP and crying. They told me it's not a real emergency and it would only come out of courtesy. 

At this point I am so confused as to how everyone is just ignoring the fact that he is STILL throwing up. It's been hours and no one has explained anything to me and are visibly upset that I have questions at all. 

I try to calm down my husband and he wants to rest and begs for an IV and is extremely desperate and crying hard. I ask the nurse if that's still possible she turns to the female doctor and asks her to talk to me. The doctor gives me a death stare, says ""Oh I need to talk to you alone"", pulls me into a room, shuts the door and basically says I was wrong for wanting to leave and that I must wait in the car if my husband wants to stay. My husband has anxiety issues and won't let me leave his side so that was not going to happen, I explained that to her and she said we should both leave and do whatever we want. I recorded the entire conversation. 

When I asked what was the issue she didn't say anything but laughed. I asked her what was so funny about my husband being on the floor uncontrollably throwing up and her refusing an IV. She doesn't say anything. I paid (more than the price listed online) and left. 
 
I'm not sure if this is normal but I am still in shock as to how I was spoken to. I work in customer service and would never allow that sort of treatment. It was rude, unnecessary and insulting.  I was trying to do what is best for my husband since and clearly was the only one concerned. And of course, no diagnosis. Complete waste of time and money. 

If you don't feel well, don't stop here. You'll leave feeling worse and will probably have multiple people tell you different things. Maybe a few ugly stares too. 

One star for the shot they gave him, that helped temporarily. But honestly, google gave me more information than these people did. 

If anyone knows where I can submit a complaint with the audio of this doctor laughing at my husband's condition and continuously insulting me, let me know."
487,"Firstly I'd like to say that I do like the doctors at the practice a lot! (especially mine)
However, their billing department is horrible! Because of their incompetencies my credit is shot while I try to get a loan for a new home.
I had a left over balance of $74.55 for a problem where I had paid well over a thousand dollars for already. I had moved to a new location, and they couldn't get a hold of me for that $74.55. If they only left a single voicemail that I had an unpaid balance, I would immediately get it taken care of. However, they never did!
I finally received a bill from them at the new address that was forwarded to me, and paid the balance in full. The procedure was nine months before. Austin Gastroenterology sent the account to collections despite the payment, and never contacted the collections agency that the account was already paid in full.
Now the collection for the $74 is on my credit record. It destroyed my credit score, and the only way to fix all of this is to pay the collections agency a fee to send a record deletion letter to me so that I can then contact all three credit companies to get the collection removed. If the account is simply denoted as paid, it will still affect my credit score, so it has to be marked as deleted. Not only that, the process takes 45-60 days. All the while I'm supposed to be applying for a home loan and my rental lease will be expiring. Supposedly there are agencies that can speed up the process but I'm looking at $115 of fees, and countless hours of dealing with companies, letters, forms, etc.
Thanks a lot for ruining my credit and hope for a home because of a $74 charge and your failure to contact a customer who was actually happy with you initially!"
488,"I am very disappointed in the service I've received from this location I will never ever return. I can't believe that in the year 2016 you don't have access to email or fax that operates without unplugging the telephone.

My first problem with this location was the staff trying to get a prescription filled. I wanted to speak to someone that could look up some information from the eye doctor stating that I had gotten my eyes examed and that everything was okay for me to have a refill on my prescription I had my eye exam at least two to three weeks prior. No one can find the information and really didn't care to help me so I had to return to the eye doctor who had done the exam which they had guaranteed me they had sent. I asked them to please send it again. Called the center back and told them that my exam would be sent again please call me when they received. Of course! no one called me. Call the center back to ask if I could get my refill and then 3 days later I receive my refill. At that time it had been going on two weeks without medication.

My problem with the center now is that I'm in South America and I needed some information on my labs my blood work. I called and asked directly for records did not want to go thru the front desk or staff. I especially said records department I spoke to a young lady who was willing to help me I advised her that I was in South America in Columbia that I would not be able to get the records I would send my husband. She said that there would be no problems with me getting the records she told me exactly how much they were going to cost $6.50 she said that I had 7 pages. My husband arrived to pick up the papers and front desk said that he could not receive them they said they had no way approving that he was authorized to pick up my paperwork and that I would have to do it I would have to come in to pick them up my husband explained that I was in South America and that I have spoken to someone in and she said it would be fine the lady continue to say that she would lose her job if she wou give him the information instead of looking up who was authorized to receive my information which is my husband. Then there was another female who came to the window and told my husband that she would not talk to him any longer and close the sliding window at that time I became very upset because I'm on the other end of phone trying to explain to them what was going on and they wouldn't even touch the phone. The 2nd woman said they had no fax or email were they could help me with this. My husband became very frustrated and left I asked him to go back in there to get a form so we can get this taken care of. So of course I'm in Columbia my husband has to email this information to my niece has to make a copy I had to fill it out get it notarized and then email it back to my house because they have no way for it to be faxed or email this is what they said. Now it is going to take me about another week and a half for my husband to get my records to me. All of this could have been taken care of by email this is 2016! And im sure that have access to email and fax.

I will never recommend this Center to to anyone that is suffering from lupus, arthritis or any type of bone or immune disease."

490,"This was my first time going to this Doctor office on my HMO dental plan. I hadn't gone to the dentist in 8 months and needed a cleaning. I made the appointment and also got X-rays done while I was there. Doctor Oberoi was nice enough, checked me out and the X-rays then said, 'I'll see you next time for a cleaning'.  I was like, 'what do you mean? That's why I'm here'...so they couldn't handle doing both an X-ray AND a cleaning? I have never, ever encountered this and is such a WASTE OF MY TIME! Apparently, there is a difference between a basic and extensive cleaning...so does that mean when I need a teeth cleaning, do I need to make two appointments with one just to evaluate which cleaning I need? Makes NO sense. Now I have to make ANOTHER appointment and wait in the waiting room, take time off work...again, just because this office can't get their process down for both X-rays and cleanings in one shot."
491,"I had cataract surgery at OCB by Dr Peter Rapoza in the sumer of 2008.  Dr Rapoza was a very nice, charming guy whom I felt very comfortable with.  My biggest and only complaint about the procedure was the over three and a half hour wait before even being called in for prep.  My appt was for 1:30 PM.  I didn't get called in until 4:45 PM.  My ride home had already shown up and had to spends those useless hours with me.  Needless to say I was furious.  Not the kind of mood you want to be in just beofre surgery.  I mentioned the long wait as constructive feedback, to Dr Rapoza at my first follow-up appointment.  He laughed it off and dismissed it as a scheduling snafu.  No acknowledgement, no apology.

Dr. Rapoza told me upfront, that cataract surgery on someone who is still relatively young, could result in a subsequent blurring of vision.  Opaqification of the Posterior Capsule was the official term.  The remedy for this would be a simple laser procedure.  A couple of zaps and I would be fine.

Fast forward to this past Monday when I was scheduled to have this laser procedure known as a YAG at 2:30 PM in OCB's Waltham office.  I checked in and was brought to the procedure room.  And then left there for over an hour.  By 3:35 PM I was sick of waiting and headed toward the reception desk to reschedule.  Dr Rapoza came thru a door, caught me in the hall and ushered me back to the procedure room.  No acknowledgement of the long wait and no apology.  Sixty seconds later, the procedure was done and he asked me to sit for ten minutes before I left.  I waitd the ten minutes, then went home.

At about 5:15 PM, my eye started to feel scratchy and irrirtated. I guessed this was to be expected.  It got progressively worse and worse until the pain was unbearable and my eye was blood red and weeping.  When I speak of unbearable pain, take it from someone who has had several episodes of kidney stones.  This pain was worse.  Conviced that something was wrong, at 5:45 PM, I called OCB's 800 number and the answering service took my info and said they would page the opthamologist on call.  After about 15 minutes, I took two Tylenol, put a cold cloth on my eye and reclined on the sofa to wait for the phone call.  I drifted off to sleep and awoke at 7:45 PM, two hours later.  The pain was still intense an no one had called me back.  The phone was right next to my head.  I would have heard it.  I even checked my caller ID device.  No call had been made.  I called the answering service again and explained the situation.  They said they would page the doctor again.

A little after 8:00, a woman called me back explaining that she was the OCB doctor on call.  I immediately told her that I had called two and a half hours prior.  She huffingly explained that she received no prior page.  She then went on to tell me that after a laser procedure, ""some discomfort isto be expected"".  I told her that the pain was and had been extreme.  Her response was that it was ""no big deal"" and that I was ""fine"".  She seemed quite put out to have been bothered in this fashion and couldn't wait to get off the phone.  I told her it was unacceptable to not have an emergency call returned.  She replied that she had just received the page and ""now I've called you back"".  In other words, I've covered my ass.  I was so angry, I informed her that OCB and Dr Rapoza had just lost a patient and hung up.  She never asked me what my symptoms were.  Never asked me about the pain or level of pain.  Never asked me what the eye lookedlike or how my vision was.  Nice.

Much later that night, I sent a very angry email via the OCB website.  Two days later, OCB's Compliance Officer called me offering all manner of emapthy and apologies.  She explained that the answering service had been at fault for the first page not being sent to the doctor on call.  She also admitted after hearing my version of events, that the woman who called me back had handled my call completley inappropriately, that I was not triaged correctly and that OCB had completely failed me.  She wanted me to come back in to hve my eye checked.  I declined saying I longer trusted anyone at OCB.  She advised me to get checked out elsewhere, which I did.  During the course of our conversation, she also informed me that their doctors on call were ""fellows"" who were only with OCB for a few months at a time.  She informed me that this ""fellow"" (i.e., student, intern, trainee...) would be reported to the attending physician.  And that was the end of it.  No apology or even a phone call from Dr Rapoza.  At OCB, you are nothing but a file number with a revenue value.  You are nothing more than the next payment on someone's yacht.  Beware."

493,"Todd never ceases to amaze me with his passion, knowledge, expertise, and dedication to his Physical Therapy practice. After a disappointing experience with another physical therapist in April 2012, I discovered Todd's website online in a desperate search to heal my severe lower back pain.  Despite being a healthy young woman, I was experiencing disabling pain and unable to function on a daily basis. The pain was so intense I could not walk more than 15 feet without the harsh backlash of crippling back spasms.   After being unable to work for months, there were many days I wondered if I would ever have a normal life again.  Tolerating physical therapy has been no easy task but Todd has been there every step of the way.  I can now happily say that I am back to work full time and reclaiming my life, feeling healthier and stronger than before I met Todd.  He is caring, patient, and extremely intelligent.

I  called to reschedule Prime Dental. I got reprimanded. 
I am not going to a dentist where the staff acts that way. I'd rather had heard ""sorry to hear that, we can reschedule. Hope you feel better soon."". I've been a professional many years and you don't get anywhere in business talking that way. Prime Dental, I'm not coming to you to take care of my pearly whites."
495,"Appreciate the response, but it doesn't explain much. 

I was never even given an email, let alone told to use it to discuss the MRI. I record my visits so I don't miss things like this and nowhere in the visit was anything like this said.

I didn't expect pretty much anyone to have knowledge of the condition I had, which was why I came in with a paper describing it. My family physician had suggested trying an orthopedic surgeon because if one couldn't help me, hopefully they could point me to someone who could. Instead, I was told that my pain was probably just scar tissue from a prior surgery and that I was--and I quote--""just chasing this weird thing"". You've got to know as a physician how crushing that can be to someone who is at the end of their rope. I spent the next 30 minutes crying in the parking lot because I had no idea where to go from there.

I actually did end up being treated here in Austin, because a uniquely caring rheumatologist took the time to listen and suggested I see a thoracic surgeon. That's all I really needed."
496,"I just left this place in a worse condition than I came in. I have debilitating panic attacks and anxiety. My psychiatrist is currently switching me to another medication and the new medication isn't controlling my anxiety or panic attacks. 

Long story short I had an 11 hour panic attack today. Since my doctor's office isn't open on the weekends I decided to wait it out. When it didn't go away I decided to go to the clinic. Big mistake. 

When I got there the doctor basically told me that I shouldn't have come in, that he could see that I'd been there recently (I hadn't. I'd been there some months prior when I had another panic attack. I'd only been to this clinic twice in my life). He then proceeded to tell me that he refused to give me a prescription for adivan which I never asked for in the first place. Then he berated me for about 10 minutes telling me that I am possibly just withdrawing because most people don't know how to take medicine for panic attacks properly. 

My husband who is a social worker got furious and tried to argue with him. I told my husband to calm down and informed the doctor that I'd been sober for 6 years and am aware of addiction issues that certain medicines can cause. He just continued to basically call me a drug seeker, told me that I poorly manage my anxiety, that I shouldn't come to the emergency room when I have a panic attack, and very condescendingly told me that my panic attacks weren't even a big deal because they weren't life threatening. 

The plus in all this was that the nurse there was extremely kind. When I had a nervous break down because of now the doctor was treating me she closed the door and talked to me telling me that I hadn't done anything wrong coming there. I truly appreciate her being there in that moment. 

I can honestly say that I've never felt this low in my life regarding my mental illness. I've struggled with it my whole life and I've always been proactive about getting help for it when I need it. This was the first time I encountered someone in the medical field who reacted towards it with contempt and disdain.  I've never been treated so horribly by anyone. I'm still in shock that this even happened. 

Do not go to this clinic if you have mental health issues. Please, for the sake of your own mental health seek help elsewhere."
497,"It's taken me about two months to write this review because I was nervous that I would not be able to express the breadth of my gratitude for Dr. Reid and all of the wonderful women at Restora Austin. 
Well, here goes...
         I made an appointment for a consultation  with Dr. Reid in 2011 after researching several Austin surgeons. Dr. Reid's  reviews were fantastic, so I made the call. The rest, as they say, is history. Perky breasts were never an attribute I possessed, even as a teenager, and I had been miserable with the size and weight of my sagging breasts since as long as I could remember.  The day of my initial consultation with Dr. Reid was fraught with both excitement and apprehension. I imagined an office full of Barbie dolls and a surgeon who would not only discuss my breasts, but also point out all of my other faults.
         That prejudgement could not have been further from the truth and I  was pleasantly surprised that the office was not full of  barbie- like automatons. All of the employees are natural, gorgeous, and above all kind and highly professional. Dr. Reid is a genial, enthusiastic, and a true gentleman. He, along with the amazing Brandy, discussed my options and I left feeling elated, even though I knew that I would not be able to afford the operation for sometime. They followed up with me several times nonetheless. It felt as if they really cared about my needs as a human being and a patient.
         Fast forward two years and I could finally afford the surgery. I returned to Restora for another consultation. We together decided that I would be happy with a lift and an implant to fill out my  shapeless bosom. I was excited to finally be able to have the procedure, so much so that it almost felt like a dream. I had my misgivings about the implant part of the procedure and so I went back to Restora for two more consults, just to be sure. I was not charged for the consults and they welcomed me back each time with open arms and smiles on their faces. The last consultation really showed me once again what a remarkable person Dr. Reid truly is. I was worried that the implants would be too heavy and I described as best I could the way I wanted to feel in my body after the procedure. He blew me away because he suggested that maybe a lift and a reduction would actually be better for me. The amazing part was that he would have made a few thousand dollars more had we stayed with the initial procedure that included implants. It was then that I truly knew I'd selected the right surgeon for me. Dr. Reid is not solely concerned with monetary gains nor does he want to make all women look the same. Instead, I  believe his goal is to make people feel good in their own bodies. He is the exact opposite of what I expected from a plastic surgeon.
         Beyond his huge heart, Dr. Reid is a master surgeon. I  had the procedure on December 20th 2013 and couldn't be happier. I barely had any pain, swelling, or bruising. Oh, and my breasts look and feel great! I am able to stand up straight, exercise easily, and go braless for the first time since puberty! It is an amazing feeling, and I have Dr. Reid and the entire Restora team to thank. I would trust my closest friends and family in Dr. Reid's hands and I plan on being a lifelong patient. 
In addition to the surgery, Dr. Reid recently treated my forehead with botox and I am as smooth as my eighteen year old self! Dr. Reid is absolutely brilliant and he knows just the right amount one needs to achieve their best result. I am truly grateful that there are plastic surgeons out there like Dr. Reid!"

499,"I gave them my insurance information so they can check my benefits. They came back and said they have verified everything with insurance and the procedures are covered. Later, I received a bill with some stuff not covered.
I questioned and they blamed it on insurance. The reality was they did not ask insurance the right questions. 
I then called insurance and got clear information. I have had this insurance for a long time and never had any issues. Never have I had any issues with dentists.
Also, this procedure was not really necessary. Shitty business tactic. On top of that, the front ladies were super defensive and very unprofessional. They lack training and common courtesy. 
Oh, and they are very pushy and try to sell you bunch of stuff."
500,"This review is for all of the nonsense that I have personally had to deal with as a student here.  I am honestly fed up with the general attitude here.  Giving it 2 stars because of neutral to good experiences I've had with some members of staff.

Freshman year: I go to my primary care doctor.  I tell him I have these horrible headaches.  He literally tells me to just get sleep.  Um.  Ok.  

Sophomore year: I have this massive 2nd degree burn.  I go to urgent care, literally no patients waiting there.  I have to wait an excruciatingly long time before I get treated.  When the doctor is ready to see me, she says, ""Oh we have patients staying overnight who have more urgent concerns than yours.""  No apology.  To top it off, the primary treatment I am given is this topical cream that, after a quick google, I find out, ""prolongs healing time"" and shows no ""real indications of efficacy.""  I get by on codeine.  

Junior year: I go to an urgent care having filled out a survey.  My thyroid might actually be infected.  A doctor sees me, and she tells me, ""Oh, we don't treat thyroid issues in urgent care.  It's not urgent.  You have to go see primary care."" I guess I would have really appreciated it if they had just emailed me to not show up rather than making me show up and wasting my time.

The next day, I phone in to try to schedule a primary care appointment.  She asked me why I didn't call yesterday, and I told her that I had a lot of work I was trying to take care of.  She literally scoffed at me.  She also was both extremely unhelpful and condescending when I asked her about the steps I would need to take to treat thyroid issues and . . . I'm fairly certain that she doesn't understand the difference between getting the ok for a thyroid screen and actually getting a screen.  She honestly didn't seem to know what she was doing in general.  It goes without saying that it is extremely frustrating to talk to someone who is both illogical and also arrogant about it.  Never in my life have I dealt with such terrible service from health staff.

Point being, HUHS, step up your game.  We as students go to you to be treated, not aggravated."
501,"I like it here. The staff and amenities are very nice. I've been four times and I always go for an hour. The quality of my experience has a lot to do with who I am sharing the space with. The sauna is a silent space, but you can hear folks in the shower area. You can actually hear people in the hot tubs too, from inside the sauna, if they are loud enough. On each visit I seem to have a really nice half hour, the other half hour my experience is lessened by the conversations happening in the hot tub space. I guess it is the luck of the draw? I know they ask folks to be mindful of the volume of their voice, as wellness treatments are in session. I am not opposed to asking a couple to please keep their voices down, but I've noticed it just takes one couple socializing and quickly the whole hot tub area is full of people chatting away. I'm not comfortable addressing the entire group at once. I have asked the front desk what I should do in this situation. They said I can ask them to come out to speak with everyone. I may try this in the future, but have been hesitant to do so so far. As a relative newcomer to this space I am trying to tread lightly. The front desk made me feel like I would be supported if I enlisted their help which I do appreciate. They also mentioned that while the intention of this space is to be a healing space, many people do want to use it as a place to socialize. I am sympathetic to that. They do have a completely silent time that interests me, but it is late at night. Maybe in the future they will have some silent times during the day and possibly some ""social"" times for folks that are interested in that."
502,"Dr. Herron is an amazing pediatrician with experience, compassion, and a true heart for children. She has a solo practice which gives a much cozier feel than the typical big group practices so common today. As grandparents raising a grandchild, we had been having trouble finding a practice that would accept us since we did not possess all of the requisite medical records and our grandson had not had all of his immunizations. As an example, one Decatur practice I called was accepting new patients and we had the right insurance, but I was told we would just have to ""go to the Health Department"" for care because of our non-standard situation. Dr. Herron and her staff welcomed us and went out of their way to locate necessary information and help in every way possible to get our little guy on track. This is not a cookie cutter practice or one with a focus on brisk efficiency. Appointments take time, in part because Dr. Herron teaches medical students and they often come in to ask initial questions or accompany Dr. Herron during the examination. We always approach our visits with patience and treat everyone there with kindness and respect, and in return we have found everyone on the staff to be more than helpful and accommodating. We love Dr. Herron, whose depth of experience and knowledge, sense of humor, candor, and willingness to spend time to get to know her little patients are priceless. Yes, it is true that an office visit may last 2 hours. It is true that the parking lot is small. These factors are insignificant to us compared to the quality of care we receive and the kindness with which our little one is treated.

Update 8/25/19
Dr. Herron recently moved her practice. The new space is in a charmingly renovated historic building in Midtown and is a bit smaller, but it is lovely and the parking is much easier to navigate. Unfortunately, there is a parking fee, but it was reasonable. We took our grandson to the new location on Friday for a sick child visit. Dr. Herron actually called to check on him on a SUNDAY and decided to call in a prescription after talking with us about his ongoing symptoms (and chatting a bit with her little patient). This was definitely above and beyond and speaks to Dr. Herron's commitment to the children in her care."
503,"Leader Dental associates have now become D2 Dental Associates. have been taking my family there for over 10 years. Sadly Dr. Leader has sold the Practice to the New Owners Doctor's David and Daria Hornung..

Dr. Leader will still be there on Thursdays seeing patients. He is now pretty much teaching dentistry full time at Tuft's Dental School. We wish you well Dr. Leader.

Myself & my family met Dr. Daria today for the first time..She is a sweet caring and very nice person. We were very pleased with her kindness and professionalism. 

Well I'm not really digging the place anymore. It's to Posh & has a very sterile atmosphere.  Sadly all of the original staff are now gone. with the exception of Jess who used to be the top assistant. now I see poor Jess sitting in the back making cold calls..

This place is very high pressure sales procedure orientated.. very off putting. 

The worst thing about D2 is the secretary is very rude and condescending. the last time my wife called to reschedule an appointment 2 days ahead. The secretary threatened her with a $50 cancellation fee. their policy is 24hrs. Just rude.. My wife will no longer come here."
504,"My mom went in with a bladder infection....and now, 5 months later...has had a total colectomy due to contracting Clostridium Difficile C-Diff...is on a ventilator due to becoming so ill and weak.  This place is filthy.  Poor contact procedures, slow to diagnose and an isolation procedure that is a freaking joke.
Run.  Run like hell.  This place is very bad.  Had they diagosed the problem sooner, my mom would be up and about and living life.  As it is, she is in Select Specialty Hospital (don't even get me started on that place) stuck on a ventilator and extremely weak.  There is another woman there with the same story...bladder infection....c-diff....colectomy....on a vent.
They destroyed my mother with something that was totally preventable if they had better procedures in place for hospital-born illnesses."
505,"I have been seeing Dr. Stephanie K. Fabbro at Buckeye Dermatology for the past year and have nothing but good things to say about her. I have struggled with acne for the past 10 years and for the first time in my life, I have clear skin. During my struggle, I have visited at least 6-7 different dermatology offices and have never had any success with anyone else. 

I completed a course of Accutane with Dr. Fabbro that took around 8 months. I have visited this office once a month during my 8 month course, and twice after being off of Accutane. In total, I have visited this office between 10-12 times within the last year. There has only been 1 time that I have had to wait to be seen for my appointment. When I arrive, I check in and am taken back to be seen within 10 minutes. Dr. Fabbro is always on time and very professional. She really cares about her patients and works hard for them. The front desk personnel and other employees are very friendly and helpful as well.

I love this office and recommend anyone to visit Dr. Fabbro. As long as I live in Columbus, I will continue to be a patient here."
506,"WALKED OUT OF THE EXAM ROOM AFTER AN HOUR AND 15 MINUTE LONG WAIT. HORRIBLE EXPERIENCE. 

Was in last night. Absolutely no warning on how soon I would be seen. Guy at the front desk absolutely reeked of cigarettes, was extremely rude about why I had come in to the center (was laughing, being very short and almost standoffish) and was just overall extremely unprofessional. His biker jacket and helmet were spread across the counter. Did NOT seem like a medical office. I CANNOT STRESS THIS ENOUGH.

I sat in the patient room for over an hour simply waiting for someone to come into the room to check on me. It was DIRTY. There was filth on the walls, small pieces of some sort of plastic trash on the floor and areas of the walls where paint had been scraped off. Not ONE TIME did someone come into the room to make sure that I was okay. However, I could hear FastMed employees in the hallway saying ""Only two hours left!"", ""Thank God!"", ""I can't WAIT to go home"". It was SO unbelievably unprofessional. Didn't seem like they cared about patients in the building, AT ALL.

After waiting for over an hour and 15 minutes, I decided to just get up and leave because no one had checked on me for 45 minutes and was just completely fed up with the experience through and through.

Being in the building literally gave me an anxiety attack. The front desk worker being rude, the lack of ""care"", the piercing silence of the building and the dirty state of the rooms- the person that I was with literally compared the experience to BEING IN A PRISON.

If I could give this place a zero, I would give it 0/5 stars. One of the worst medical experiences of my life. I've been to plenty of other ""fast med"" places and they have handled my cases quickly and professionally. Not here. STAY VERY VERY FAR AWAY! Go right up the street to the other place. At least you won't feel bullied when you talk to the employees."
507,"Very Poor and Misguided service. I went to this hospital looking for urgent care on Jan 2 (because I was guided by Intel clinic to go there).
When I arrived I asked the receptionist where the urgent care was and was informed there was no urgent care here but I could go to emergency. Now I do have Kaiser Insurance and I made it through Triage and waited for an hour before meeting an actual doctor who inspected me for 5 mins and prescribed me an ibuprofen. No one informed me that I should not be in ER and instead go to urgent care in some other location. I was billed 1000 USD for 10 min visit. It is utterly ridiculous and I feel deceived."
508,"I wish I had listened to the other people who gave negative reviews on here.  Pretty much everything they said happened to them, happened to me.  Weeks of my trying to secure an appointment with the clearly uninterested owner.  When I got there she asked me nothing of my history.  I'm not even sure I got a shiatsu massage. . . if a shiatsu massage is exactly the same as a regular massage only with no lotion then yes.  The massage itself was neither good nor bad.  The owner pretty much interrogated me the whole time and talked about unrelaxing subjects such as pediphiles and illegal immigrants. . .There was no music, but there was construction noise.  She left the room to get her phone, which rang periodically for extended periods of time during the massage.  It was by far the worst experience I've ever had in a place of business.  She finished up by condescending to me about my groupon and saying she'd never had one used before. . . which is clearly a lie given the other reviews on here.  The whole thing left me confused and tense."
509,"Made an appointment online. When I got here was told even though the website takes reservations  they do not a accept the online reservations for X-rays. And that someone should have called me to reschedule. Well that did not happen. Anyway at reception they did make a new appointment for me. So make sure to call to make your appointments and not use the website if you need an X-ray. 

So now I am back for the new appointment time and only waited 15 mins.  Alyssa was my X-ray tech. What a sweetheart! Alyssa alone took my review from a 3 to a 4 star.  Also this location is has a very nice atmosphere. Quiet and nicely decorated. Not as sterile as most medical offices."
510,"IMPORTANT: This is about the receptionst + naturopath. I see great posts about the Chiropractor and Massage Therapist. Please know I did NOT meet them and they have nothing to do with this review. 

CAME IN WITH VERTIGO & A MIGRAINE and left feeling baffled by how I was treated. 
For reference: This is the only negative review I've ever written.

I came down with a Migraine & Vertigo. I had recently moved and needed help asap-- which meant finding a new doc. I looked up this place excited to find a new naturopath and chiropractor etc all under one roof right near my new home.  I called asked to come in sooner rather than later because it was urgent due to the migraine and vertigo. (pretty hard to function with even just one of those going on)

The gal on the phone was super nice & helpful. Said she could fit me in at 3pm the next day, and then she said ""actually it would help us out if you could come at 2:45pm.

I said Sure. Done. 
I went to work the next day and arrive at my appt time and the gal at the desk says ""Uhh didn't you get my message?"" 

I said ""no I've been at work all day, why?""

RECEPTIONIST (not the gal I set the appt with): well the problem is the doctor has another appointment coming up at 4pm (mind you its 2:47 when we're talking) and we don't have any paperwork on you, so she can't do your appt.... Or....umm I guess she can see you right now (clearly this is the option she doesn't want me to take) 

Here's the best part... she continues: 
WE'RE STILL GOING TO CHARGE YOU FOR THE $200... but you're not going to get a full 90 min appointment. SO ITS BASICALLY A WASTE OF YOUR TIME AND YOUR MONEY.

(mmmkay this is an interesting way to welcome a new client)

She seems irritated with me, though I'm a first time client. The only thing I'd done was make an appt, and show up for it. 

I was completely baffled by the attitude, as well as with everything she was saying.
I said ""Umm, I'm confused. No one asked me to fill out any paperwork.""

RECEPTIONIST: Yeah but we need it so again,  you can pay the $200 but you're not getting a whole appt. So its probably a waste of your time. 

ME: Well showing up for an appt you're telling me I can't have is also a waste of my time. Can I speak to the Doctor? I don't really understand why you're speaking to me this way. And I don't know why you keep telling me you're going to charge me for a 90 min appt, but not give me one. This doesn't feel very good.

The girl disappears into the back and I get to hear her and the doctor whispering together for another 5 minutes. (awkward) 

The doctor then comes out and says ""Yeah we're really sorry"" 
followed by the exact same things the receptionist says....except she adds insult to injury by adding ""the thing is, I have an appt at 4pm and I can't change a client's appointment."" 

ME: You mean you can't change a client's appt....except mine? Which you're canceling while I stand here in front of you.

DOC: ""Well you can come in if you want to""

Yeah lady, I love having a migraine, and vertigo, and then showing up for an appt you apparently don't want me to have, being treated like an annoyance on top of it.... and told by your receptionist that you'll charge me extra for it. GREAT IDEA.

Here's the worst thing this doctor did... or really didn't do:

Neither the doctor nor the receptionist ever asks me WHY I made the appt. 
No one asks if I am okay.
No one ever asks if the appt for an urgent reason. (which it was)
No says come in, sit down, have a glass of water, let's work it out, and see how we can at least get started helping you today. 

No one cared that I needed help today. 

You can definitely get something done in a hour and fifteen minutes.... if you want to. 

At the very least you can not make your mistake your client's problem. You can instead try to make a new client, who is sick, feel welcome and cared for... instead shoved out the door... only to go home no better than when she arrived.

I would never suggest going to a doctor who treats people this way. HELPING people is supposed to be your entire reason for serving. And being courteous should be a given. 

Having just moved to the area, my husband and I were thrilled to find this place.... thinking we'd found a chiropractor, massage, and doctor all in one place. I can safely say, we will never return. 

I have worked with other naturopaths (in our old home here in Portland as well as before we lived in oregon). I have never had a problem. Never had a bad experience. Never.

And I can also safely say... I have never in all my years been treated so poorly in a place that is supposed to care for people."
511,"The friendliness of the staff is the only reason I'm giving this place two stars.

I had to bring my fiance here today because she hasn't been feeling well the last few days, and kind of collapsed today, but was okay. Probably just pushing herself too much while being sick.

Anyway, we get there and there are four, maybe five people in front of us. We are told the whole process shouldn't take more than an hour and a half. Not bad. So, an hour and fifteen minutes in we're finally being called back.

We get to the room and fifteen minutes later the lady comes to take diagnostics, and tells us the doctor will be there shortly. FORTY-FIVE MINUTES LATER the doctor comes in. Dr. Adenupe. If you, by some unfortunate circumstance, have to come here, request to NOT SEE this doctor.

He comes in and asks what's wrong and pays absolutely no attention to her at all, and asks her to repeat herself two more times. Wow. Also, while she was trying to describe her symptoms, he would interrupt her several times with questions not at all related to her symptoms.

She mentioned in passing that she was ""dieting,"" and then explained to him that she had really only cut back on bread and cheese, and that she is a vegetarian. She also explained that she does eat very healthy, which she does, and was just trying to lose a few pounds before our wedding. He would later explain that the reason she fainted was because of her ""extreme diet"" and made an inappropriate joke about her trying to fit into a dress. The guy was just rude and awkward and very much gave no fucks.

Also, when she was trying to explain the the lymph node behind her ear and one of the ones on her jaw were aching, and that she had an ear ache, the guy was really confused about what she was talking about, even though she was pointing where it was swollen, which is very visible to the eye. He finally found it after three or four attempts. 

The best advice he gave, which was just common sense, was to go to the emergency room if she gets worse. Thanks, Dr. House.

He did suggest it may be an upper respiratory infection and prescribed some amoxicillin and over the counter cough suppressant and allergy medicine.

All in all we were there for three hours, which we were told it was due to a lack of physicians. That's somewhat understandable, but I don't know if it's good enough of a reason for three total hours with such an inattentive, quick, rude doctor, There may be other doctors there that are good, it sounds like it from the other reviews.

All in all, I would not recommend this place. If you have, HAVE to, just ask not to see Dr. Adenupe."
512,"I have never been afraid of the dentist until I learned that I was going to get my wisdom teeth taken out. I wasn't sure what my options were before coming in the day of the procedure, but I was certainly shaking and turning blue with fear. 

Dr. Orlov immediately took heed to my discomfort and although it pushed the schedule back an hour, he made sure he did everything necessary (with medication) to get me to relax and by the time the procedure started/finished, I was a happy camper. Not to mention, his assistant was very sweet, reassuring and a jokester who made me laugh throughout my initial nervousness.

Even before this wisdom teeth ordeal, I got a sense that Dr. Orlov is a sincere/real dentist. When I first got my check up and we addressed the issues that I had, he gave me a true sense of what was necessary and immediate vs. what was not urgent/could be addressed later. I never got the feeling that he was trying to rip me off (like I've experienced in other dental offices) or make up problems that did not exist. 

My 7 year-old also goes there and he loves it. They were so careful with him and everytime I go there, they ask how he is doing. 

I really feel like I am visiting family when I come to All Dental Center. In reading some of these comments, I am confused because I feel quite opposite. 

I know they aren't always bubbly/fake and maybe that comes off as rude. But I know they get the job done right and always respond to my needs. 

I don't see myself going anywhere else as long as I am in Boston!"
513,"I don't know what you people are talking about! ""Rude receptionist?"" She had never said a rude word to me and I've been going to this office for as long as I can remember. To put this into perspective, I'm 22 and lived in Austin my whole life and can't remember EVER seeing another doctor. 
This doctor has taken care of me and my family for as long as I can remember. The staff is kind and caring. I have no complaints what-so-ever about this doctor :)"
514,"I hate going to the dentist (who doesn't?) but after a couple of me teeth broke, I had to find a dentist. I made the mistake of going to Castle Dental first. Left with a bad feeling, so I opted for a second opinion. That's when I found Austin Family Dentist. Dr. Tucker's quote for all my work was $3,000 less than Castle. Even better, when I started having work done, I wasn't in near as much pain as I expected. Maybe there's a light stream of nitrous oxide in the air here, or if he is actually a wizard, but I definitely don't dread the dentist near as much as I used to."
515,"I didn't think this doctor was in business anymore, but I Googled her after I found an old bill that I found from 2002. I saw the review by Dana H. and laughed my a$$ off!

So I, also, found this dentist through my insurance network. My experience started in a similar way with the unfriendly staff member. The guy who worked there was nicer, but, ultimately, he still didn't resolve my issue(s).

The first time I went in, I went for a cleaning. Everything was find and dandy. The x-rays and cleaning went fine. I had a cavity on one of my molars, so I set up an appointment to come back for the filling. They asked if I wanted amalgam (silver) or the composite (tooth-colored) filling. I said I wanted amalgam since it was covered under my insurance. They gave me literature on AMALGAM fillings and I was on my merry way home.

The second, and final, visit, I went in for my amalgam filling and the doctor and her assistant worked on my molar. When they were done, the assistant mentioned what happens with composite fillings. I was wondering why she was telling me this information. I asked for a mirror and saw that they gave me a composite filling! I had never gotten one before, so I didn't know the procedure. I figured she was a young dentist at the time, so she had new technology on how to do amalgam fillings. I was so upset! I said I didn't ask for that. She said it was written on the chart. I pulled out the literature about amalgam fillings that they had given me on my first visit. They were completely shocked at their mistake. After months of phone calls, they eventually fixed it and there was a credit of maybe $20 on my account. Months went by and I kept waiting and waiting for them to send me my refund, but I never received it. 

Finally, one day I called and they said they ""fixed my account"". I asked when I could expect my check and they said there was actually a balance of $5.00 and as a courtesy, they just wiped off. They said there WAS a credit of $20.00, but then there was a charge of $25.00 from an appointment for which I never showed up! At that point, I was so furious, but I held in my rage. I made sure that there was no balance and asked them to send me something saying that there was nothing due. I received it in the mail and have kept it ever since, just in case they tried to come back and say that I had a balance. I told all of my family never to go there. 

To be fair, the doctor was actually nice and she did a pretty good job so I gave two stars instead of one, but the administration messed up my whole experience. 

In addition, in 2004, I found my old dentist that I LOVE!!! They are brothers: Drs. David and Kelly Harden. I went to them when I was still in high school. They are awesome. Recently, I changed insurance and had to find another in-network dentist. Dr. Arias' office on Colonial (A Family Dental) sucks, too. They told me that my daughter didn't have any cavities, but she actually had TWO of them. They said for new patients, they do not promise a cleaning. My husband and I were outraged. The lady asked if we wanted to schedule a cleaning which meant that we had to pay for a separate appointment. My husband declined and we left.

I am never leaving Dr. Harden again! Try them out. They are PPO only, though, but their customer service is excellent and their dental work is superb!"
516,"Cute selection, they had some very nice frames I would have loved to find outore about. But the four employees helping three customers and two who entered after me did not seem to care for my business. Not so much as even an acknowledgment of my existence. No, ""I'll be with you shortly,"" or ""Do you need any help?"" 

I'll go to different location because my insurance gets me a good deal here."
517,"My biggest complaint here is NOT the doctors and nurses - they were extremely helpful. My complaint is in regards to the woman at the front desk. She is an African American woman with long black hair and she needs some lessons in customer service.

I came here to get tested for Covid - nerve wrecking enough, right? I got in line at 9:15 - my friend got there at 9am. When my friend got there, she noticed the line and thought ""OK LET ME CHECK IN INSIDE!"" She walked in thinking she had to check-in prior to getting in the line. The woman told her there was no check-in available and to wait in the line. At 11:20am, the woman comes outside and states that she cut the line off at 8:20am because appointments were arriving...WHAT?! About 50 people left FURIOUS - so we were about 10 left in line with my friend and I included. She stated they would be cutting off testing until 5pm. We decided that we would wait in line because we were already there and didn't want to wait in another line to be told the same thing. She came out, took 6 people inside and told us that she was cutting it off at us and two gentlemen in front of us. Again, we decided we would just wait. The gentlemen seemed to annoy her, so they just left. She told us we couldn't wait - that we had to leave if not she was going to call the police. When we asked why we were being told to leave, she stated that I had been turning away patients at the door...WHAT?! Apparently a patient inside told her that (he came with his son and since i was first in line, asked if he had to wait outside - i told him if he was testing then yes to which he then stated his visit was unrelated so i told him to go inside). At that point, the line grew to about 8 people (with me and my friend being the first two in line) and about 4 people stood up and were like ""NO SHE DID NOT!"" She refused to listen, and made us leave - letting us know that there would be no line until 4pm.

Fast forward, I got an appointment (write to their management if you're ever turned away by the way - i emailed them and had them call me two hours later and fit me in!) i arrived at 3:47pm - AND THERE WAS A HUGE LINE! After she made us leave! We were shocked! We walked in to check-in to our appointment and she looked at us and just stated ""What do you want?"" After we let her know we were there for our appointment, she made us step outside because there weren't enough iPads...understandable. When we were called in a couple minutes later (actually we were signaled in - she waved her arms and motioned for us to come in), we both walked in and in the most mocking tone stated ""ONE AT A TIME...ONE AT A TIME...ONE AT A TIME...Y'ALL JUST DON'T SEEM TO UNDERSTAND. ARE YOU GETTING TESTED WITH THE SAME SWAB?!"" um...NO! But we thought you were motioning for the BOTH of us! I honestly had enough of this woman and just said ""OK MA'AM! I GET IT. I GET IT. I GET IT. We misunderstood!"" and she STILL proceeded to say how we just don't seem to understand and how we think we're ""so special cuz we have Covid""...um FIRST OF ALL, no - we've had a VERY long day, had to take off of work, AND have been dealing with your nasty attitude all day. SECOND OF ALL, BIGGER NOPE! I am getting tested for Covid an already stressed enough! I don't think I'm special - i'm just as stressed as YOU!

That woman needs customer service training and a hug! She made the entire testing process MISERABLE. Honestly, as a ""nobody"" that day, my friend and I were emotionally exhausted and felt SO HELPLESS in regards to the entire situation.

PS I stated that she looked African American because that's the only indicator i can give to who she is. She did not wear her nametag even though everyone else did. I guarantee she knew we were going to try and get her name. To whoever takes their time reading this, thank you. I'd love an update as to what will be done about this woman as she made the past couple days MISERABLE for us. Thanks."
518,"Decades after having had the most minimal dental care, my aging mouth needed attention. Reviews for Stonecreek were good and it's fairly close (I live in a rural area where most services are pretty far away) so I made my choice. 
  This will be a mixed review... The facilities are nice. It's friendly, clean and always warm or cool enough. They offer a beverage, that's nice, and a cookie, too (more cavities, to fill! Lol) and there is almost no wait. The dental care is competent. I'm quite satisfied with the work so far.
  Now let's get serious. This has become a never-ending saga. I've been going for over a year now and the procedures go on and on. I still need a lot of work and it is more expensive than I was ever led to believe. They charge for absolutely everything! So far, I've  spent about $30,000 and, as I said, I'm not finished. I believe with the amount I am spending, they could render a few complimentary services. I won't go into detail, but they are nickel and diming me to death, on top of my regular bills. Also, my insurance will not pay for these services and even though they get paid after each procedure, miscellaneous bills still arrive after the fact. They often come from an outside billing service and they always  indicate that they're late. 
  They now plan to send me to a specialist for something I believed was going to be done at Stonecreek. It's not what I wanted. All this will end up costing me as much as if I were buying a house. Is this really fair? Should a person have to mortgage the farm to keep their teeth? I'm not blaming Stonecreek entirely. They're just part of a corrupt system."
519,"I didn't write ""woohoo!  As good as it gets!""--that is this site's comment.  I had a fine experience.  I paid at the end, as it the norm, and liked the fact that they took some bl. tests to be sure about something . . . didn't have to send me to another urgent care, as they had the facilities on site . . . all was explained well, and I paid a lot less than at the Seton Emergency Dept., which should be for only serious emergencies, which mine was not.  I only went to the urgent care because Medicare and Humana have been playing games since I moved here a couple of months ago, and I don't have a primary care physician yet.  And so on.  A PA saw me, not am MD, but I know their training is extensive also and her comments were appropriate and thoughtful, also helpful!  PAs and nurses are extremely knowledgeable, by the way.  I got what I wanted!  Thank you, all."
520,"1st problem:
Several months ago our teen was in for a physical/checkup during the Pediatric Urgent Care hours and the doctor (not Dr. Thomas) asked if he could adjust her back during the appointment, so we said okay, took a few seconds and thought nothing of it... until we got the bill with a large extra charge for doing so.  It just flowed with the appointment so we just figured should have been included with the regular appointment fees.  Had we known this we could have just gone to a real chiropractor and it would have been covered on our insurance.  In short, the doctor should have told us there may be an extra charge & the billing department could have done something other than just reading the doctors notes to work with us on the charge.  Yes, we did authorize it so we paid it, but the communication & customer service should have been much better.  It was a learning lesson for us to ask lots more questions in the future so make sure to ask ""is there an extra charge for that"" (and if so get a cost first) for anything they do so you don't get surprised by the bill.

2nd problem:
Most recently, our teen daughter again, went in to Pediatric Urgent Care and in the process had a urine test done.  Yesterday they called and told her that the test showed the possibility of a UTI, and if she showed any more symptoms to come in for a retest.  Today they called again to confirm which pharmacy we wanted the prescription sent too.  Since we were never told of a prescription and only to come back if symptoms returned I questioned this and was told that the culture came back positive for ecoli.  When I questioned this more, the lady on the phone said she had no record of a call yesterday... until I pushed even more about the conflicting calls, and then she magically found it.  Her excuse was that yesterdays findings were just a preliminary stick test (um, that was done during the appt.) & this was the culture test (funny that they said the results yesterday were from the culture test).  Then, to top it off, towards the end of the call she says that the prescription has been at the pharmacy since yesterday.  So much confusion, now I don't know if I trust any of it.

I give it a 1-star only because of the convenient hours (even if there was a 0-star option).  We will continue to see Dr. Paul Thomas at his other company, Integrative Pediatrics, but will go elsewhere for Urgent Care.  We will not recommend Pediatric Urgent Care because the customer service & communication with some employees/doctors is just plain horrible."
521,"First off, let me say that we have been with Dr. Thomas for years & he has been GREAT, best pediatrician ever!... however, this review is for Integrative Pediatrics & Pediatric Urgent Care as a company, in particular the off-hours/Pediatric Urgent Care side.  Several months ago our teen was in for a physical/checkup during the Pediatric Urgent Care hours and the doctor (not Dr. Thomas) asked if he could adjust her back during the appointment, so we said okay, took a few seconds and thought nothing of it... until we got the bill with a large extra charge for doing so.

I am rating a 2-star ONLY because Dr. Paul Thomas is a great pediatrician.  We will continue to see him because our kids like & trust him, but will go elsewhere for Urgent Care or when he is unavailable as his business has been on a continued down-hill path for some time now, at least in our experience with some staff & Pediatric Urgent Care.  We have referred several people to him, but will no longer recommend Integrative Pediatrics or Pediatric Urgent Care because the customer service & communication with some employees/doctors is just plain horrible."
522,"Working right around the corner from CBD has been a blessing and a curse. A blessing because for the most part their food is healthy and fresh. A curse because it can be a bit over priced for what you get, but it's the only ""healthy"" option in the area next to Thundercloud and Subway if you even count them. 

 Highlights include the homemade soups- my favs being the chicken tortilla and the french onion. They use Boar's Head meats and cheeses which is a plus, but their breads are standard loaves you'd serve your kids' PBJs on. Their cookies are large and deliciously soft. The homemade quiche and salad combo is small but tasty. They make their own salad dressings too.  

The environment is nothing to write home about. Staff is hit or miss. Don't catch the owner on a bad day, which is every other day. Really it's just her blunt Europeaness. 

They don't accept credit cards for anything under $5, which doesn't matter because you can expect to pay about $8 for sandwich, soup and a drink. They also serve breakfast items before 10am. All pretty generic stuff- toast, bagels, egg sandwiches. Do not get the breakfast tacos unless you like them microwaved with parchment paper stuck to the nuked tortilla (busted!!). Plus, there are plenty of real mexican food joints in the area if you want an actual taco.

If I could choose 2.5 stars, I would. Basically, if it weren't for my working up the street, I would have never noticed this business park eatery. If you're in the area and desperate for something healthier than Popeyes, Taco Hell or Sonic, give it a try. If you're ballin on a budget that day, keep driving."
523,"So no one likes going to get their blood drawn or peeing in a cup right? Well I have a random grouping of medical afflictions that require frequent blood draws so I know this CPL well. I've never felt the need to write a review until today and that's because I finally had a wonderful lady draw my blood. I think her name was Alyssa, young, has braces, sweet as can be. 

My veins can be frustrating and instead of just jabbing me and hoping for gold Alyssa (sorry if that isn't your name, I wish I would have double checked) spent a good few minutes carefully checking each of my arms until she found just the right spot. Once she did, ZERO pain, like I hardly felt a thing. The last time I was there it felt like the lady was mad at me and trying to slow stab me to death with a needle so this was a nice change. Thank you Alyssa (I swear I'm sorry if that isn't your name and even if it is I'm probably spelling it wrong) for making what could have been a crummy start to my day an actual pleasant one!

This would have been a 5 star rating (just for awesome Alyssa alone) but as I was waiting out front in the lobby I overhead the workers behind the desk make fun of someone's last name then again one of them teased the other about how they won't even try to pronounce ""difficult"" names. That is just plain rude and disrespectful. A little professionalism goes a long way."
524,"It really pains my heart to give them two stars because when I was a patient - I loved, loved, loved them.

I found that they actually seemed to care about my dental health and unlike a lot of the filtered reviews - they never tried to upsell me or suggest unnecessary treatments.  In fact - they talked me out of a teeth whitening. The office manager / receptionist was sweet & charming (and funny).  Both dentists were funny and pleasant.  

Unfortunately - all my warm & fuzzy feelings came to a screeching halt earlier this year.  I didn't change insurance - but my plan benefits changed.  I went in for a routine cleaning and unbeknownst to me - they were out of network so I wound up paying and arm & a leg for a routine cleaning and X-rays.

I get that the office is very busy and if I'd dropped in unexpectedly - I would be a little more understanding - but since I scheduled this appointment weeks / months in advance - I would think that it would be SOP (standard operating practice) to call my insurance company to confirm that my services are covered.  

In fact -  I know most doctors and dental offices will ask you during the check in process if your insurance has changed.  Apparently not at Kerr & Gavric.  As my nephew would say, in double fact, when I called to schedule an appointment with the dentist I used before them, I made the appointment and the next day they called me back to let me know that they would be happy to do my cleaning - but that they were no longer in network so I would have to pay $165 for x-rays and cleaning.  

I don't like wasting money.  They do a good job - but at the end of the day - who's going to pay for cleaning or any other wellness visit when they don't have to?!  I felt that the least they could have done is offer some sort of discount - and I don't mean the self-pay discount.  

So I've taken my business elsewhere."
525,"It was my first time visiting Dr. Wheeler. This doctor has wonderful reviews online and I thought why not our family needs a new doctor because we just moved to the area. Long wait, parking isn't free. It felt that they only care about how much money they can get from you, not how you feel or what you need. The nurse was very rude, not friendly at all, they charged me over $200 just for an office visit with Coca Cola insurance and I am healthy! It's Ridiculous! I'm never coming back again or recommending this place to any of my friends or family! Good luck!

Update: month later they are sending me bills to pay.. for nothing"
526,"I've been a patient at this practice for 5 years. I have finally reached a point where it's time to switch. The reason I stayed was Dr. Schneider (hence the 2 stars.) If I could give her 5 and her office 1, I would. I've had a wonderful experience with her. She is fantastic. However, the office and support staff has not been so helpful. I have held out as long as possible, but I cannot handle it anymore. Let me start from the beginning. I tried to refill my birth control and had the pharmacy submit the request. It was denied three times without any reason why. I just had a pap 6 months ago, so I figured I wasn't due for an annual appt. I started calling the office. Three unreturned calls later, I finally received a response that I needed to come in. In this time, I ran out of pills and had not taken my birth control for 8 days. When I went in, I suspected I might be pregnant. I asked Dr. Schneider to run a blood test to see. She kindly obliged. This was a Friday. I waited until Tuesday to try and obtain the results. That was a looong weekend. When I called the nurse she told me I tested negative for Rubella. I was surprised to hear this answer because we were testing for pregnancy. She says, ""Oh well, I'll call the lab and see if they haven't thrown out your blood and if they can run the test."" Four days later, I receive results. It's negative.  Now, I'm waiting for genetic testing results. I received a voicemail from the nurse on Friday after they had closed. She says, ""call back on Monday."" So, here I sit waiting to find out if I'm a carrier for genetic defects. That was a stressful weekend of waiting. It only takes a a little common sense by the nurse to make that call earlier in the day or wait until Monday so that I don't have to sit on pins and needles for another weekend. These two experiences are only part of the story. I have had a number of other negative experiences at this office. As I said, Dr. Schneider is fantastic and I would follow her to another practice. However, I'm not willing to put up with this kind of situation any longer.  I do hope she will setup shop elsewhere in the future."
527,"This was the worst experience I've ever had with medical care. I was prescribed a medication called Aldara for genital warts a couple weeks ago and after three uses I had a horrible reaction to the medication. The medication gave me a chemical burn and broke out in open sores and ulcers, everything was swollen and tender and I couldn't use the restroom without serious pain. 

    I went to Pro Med in order to seek help and relief from this reaction, instead I met Dr. Bruce Patterson. He came in and asked my symptoms and then left abruptly after I explained them. A couple minutes later a nurse came in and wanted to do a herpes test. I explained that I do not have herpes, I was tested a month ago and that this is an extreme reaction to medication I was taking. She went out and brought old Bruce back in. He took a cursory glance at my genitals and said,""Yep, that's herpes."" I explained one more time that this is a reaction to the medication, he was not listening. He said. "" I've seen a lot of herpes in my day and that is herpes."" Then left the room again abruptly but this time slammed the door. When he came back in the room he had a prescription for herpes medication and that was it. I told him that I am not taking medication that I don't need and I am in serious pain and would like treatment for my problem rather than assuming it's a different problem. At that point he started to get up and say, ""well perhaps you need a different doctor."" I didn't argue with him on that, but at this point it is Saturday and you are the one I've got. He said he would write me a prescription for painkillers and asked if I had ever taken them before. I said no. He told me he was prescribing me Vicotin, then went on to say, ""which I'm sure you know is a very strong painkiller.""  (I just told you I don't take painkillers!)
At this point I asked him, "" I don't really understand why I am being treated in this manner. I feel like you are not even listening to anything I've said.""   He said,"" I don't know why you are refusing to take the herpes test, but I guess you can live in denial all you want.   "" At that point I was soooo angry I told him fine I will take your fucking test, it's going to come back negative and then what.  My test came back NEGATIVE and I am still in pain.  

     Dr. Bruce Patterson is unprofessional and neglected to treat my symptoms or even treat me with an ounce of respect.  Here's the thing, I'm appalled by my treatment and I knew I didn't have herpes, but what if I had, this is the way a doctor tells you that you have an incurable STD.  I am seeking legal recourse so hopefully the next patient doesn't have to deal with the same unprofessionalism and neglect."
528,"I went in for an introductory special they were offering to new patients. I knew I needed some work that my regular dentist didn't handle but that was about all. I immediately got a bad vibe when I went in to make an appointment and the lady behind the desk started talking about my needing a root scaling. I was curious as to how she would know this considering I'd just had a cleaning at a different dentist three months prior and no one at this office had yet to even look in my mouth. But that was only the beginning. 

After my initial appointment they tried to convince me that I was in need of nearly $3000 in dental work.! Remember I'd just been to the dentist three months prior and not a word had been spoken of all the work that these folks were now recommending. Needless to say I immediately decided to seek out a second opinion from my primary dentist. While I was on the phone making the appointment and telling the office manager about my experience and what they wanted to do she immediately knew what I was about to say before I said it. She promptly started guessing what they were suggesting I needed and it was like she had the list in front of her. Apparently its a not uncommon practice for some offices ( I'm just speaking of dental offices in general, not necessarily ADC) to make their money by peforming procedures that you really don't need. Needless to say the second opinion from my regular dentist confirmed what I'd been suspecting: very few of the procedures they were suggesting were actually necessary. 


In fairess to them its a beautiful office with high tech equipment and a courteous professional staff. But theres a major catch to all of that high overhead. They need someone to help pay for it. Thats where you come in! They tell you they aren't on anyone's insurance. They said to me thats because they don't want to let the insurance companies dictate their patients care. Thats a nice story but it only tells half the truth. The truth is that while they offer good quality dental care, you may not really need all the work they're suggesting. Naturally insurance companies aren't in the habit of paying for work that you really don't need. But at least they are clear up front when they let you know that you and not the insurance companies are ultimately responsible for the fees they charge.

 Think of it like going to your mechanic for an oil change and while you are there they try to convince you to change all your belts, hoses, tires, brakes, wipers and get a complete overhaul of the carburator, transmission, radiator, and rear axel differential. 


Heres some advice if you are considering going:

See if they tell you if you need the following work done: 

Root scaling (BTW a root scaling costs about 3-4 times what a regular cleaning does)

Replace all your old fillings.

Crowns for old fillings they can't replace. 

Go see if they offer all of that to you. But before you agree to any of it get a second opinion and see how much of it you really need. And do some shopping around.   See how much other dentist's charge for the same service.The differences may suprise you.

As far as your insurance provider goes ask them how much they will and will not cover for certain procedures. See if they any need pre-certification or if they will reimburse after the work is already done. 

Do your homework so you are paying only what you need to pay and only for work you really need done."
529,"It truly pains me to have to write such a negative review about a place that was once FANTASTIC to take my kids to. I don't know what has happened, but it's pretty unfortunate. 

I've been bringing my kids here for at least the last 4 years. My two youngest have been going there since birth. When I first started going there the staff was fantastic, Dr. Palmer was phenomenal (she has since left) and the nursing staff were professional and caring, and the reception staff were efficient and well trained. 

It's almost like everything has exploded into mass chaos in the last year to year and a half. I don't know if this office has high turn-over or what, but no one seems to know what they're doing. One girl was rather rude. I feel like she was overwhelmed as the phone was ringing, another receptionist was asking her questions, someone was there with their child checking in, and I was standing there needing to make another appointment and get a school excuse. I was patiently waiting, however my infant was screaming. I wasn't annoyed until she got rude. 

The ONLY reason for the second star is simply because the doctor my kids see is great (Dr. Kuper). I really like her a lot, and Shannen at the front desk is absolutely delightful. In fact, she's the main reason I've hung in there as long as I have with this practice.  

I've waited for over an hour for my kids to be seen for an appointment that was scheduled weeks in advance. This is a complicated and exhausting situation with an active toddler and a very unhappy infant who wants to be at home. It is what it is with regards to the wait times. I realize they get busy, doctors, medical assistants and nurses get sick and have to call off too.


What finally killed it for me was this; First the story was that the Dublin office was consistently ""out"" of the vaccines for ""my insurance"", they ordered them but they hadn't come in yet, but the Upper Arlington office had them. So I started taking my kids to that office (yuck, by the way, the office is microscopic and looks like a cheep creepy motel from the outside. But that's a different review for a different office), then THAT office was consistently out of them and sent me on a wild goose chase to the health department for them. Really??? Plain and simple, I have a large family, a 6 month old, a toddler, 3 school aged children and I do all the scheduling and running for EVERYONE. I don't have time to figure out if it's the 3rd Wednesday of the month or the 2nd Tuesday of the month, make 12 different appointments at 9 different places to hunt down the vaccines that my kids should be getting on time at their check ups. I just don't. 

Unfortunately I'm going to be taking my kids to a different doctors office. I've been waiting for them to get it together for 6 months now... I have to be done."
530,"I am writing this for those of you who are TMJ(D) sufferers and are contemplating ""Neuromuscular Dentistry"". 
If I had known that I was about to embark upon a time consuming, poorly executed ""treatment plan""(FYI-I was never given a treatment plan), that was going to cause me SEVERE, DEBILITATING pain, I obviously would never have pursued it. 

On the first day I visited Dr. Loveless' office, I spoke with Dr. Loveless, then I went to another room where Paulina made me a temporary bite. As I was leaving, Tara asked me to write a review of my visit. (weird) The bite Paulina made me was great. I wore it on the car ride home, and my masseter relaxed enough to stop burning pain. It was miraculous, and gave me hope. Unfortunately, this did not continue.
Once I received my permanent orthotic, that I wore 24/7, I started having pain again, which I shared and was told ""okay, we'll TENs you.""
This TENsing experience often took up to a few hours; from moment of arrival to time of departure., and happened once, sometimes twice a week.
 From the moment I received my permanent orthotic, I never felt out of pain again. I often found Dr. Loveless made contradictory statements, but I followed what he said because I thought he knew what he was doing. For example, if all of my headaches, masseter pain, etc. were due to my jaw being in the wrong position, then, it would seem, once the jaw was in the right position, all pain would dissipate. Well, according to him I ""had a good bite"", but I was still experiencing a lot of occipital pain, temporal pain, and for the first time in my life, experiencing left jaw joint pain.  He tried to sell me another orthotic that would keep my jaw in place while I slept, which I declined, because it seemed to me that if  I had had a good bite, like he said, I shouldn't need it, nor would I have pain or NEW symptoms. He said I needed to go to a chiropractor because my AO joint was out of alignment. I still felt that if I had a ""good bite"" my symptoms should be decreasing rather than increasing, but went to the chiropractor against my better judgement. 
He ended up having to make me a temporary plastic orthotic ( a haphazard adjustment to my permanent orthotic had me in a horrible bite position, which his computer made perfectly clear to him-thus the jaw joint pain), that I would wear while my permanent orthotic was being repaired from his poor attention to occlusal details. I put the temporary orthotic in my mouth, told him ""it feels weird"", to which he replies ""oh. You'll get used to it."", briefly talked to me about PHASE 2, and sent me on my way. I left and went home to have lunch. Upon my first bite of food I was in excruciating pain; not only did the new orthotic cause my left jaw more pain but it also ripped my inner lower lip to shreds. What happened you ask? He didn't fit the appliance to the contours of my mouth. A competent dentist will grind away the portions of the orthotic that are too long. What a painful bloody mess. Why didn't I just take it out you ask???? Well. I tried. For hours. The bloody orthotic(literally) was tortuously stuck in my mouth. I tried calling his office, but they had closed for the day at Noon, It was a Thursday. I was finally able to pry the orthotic off of my teeth with the help of my husband TWO hours later. I repeatedly called the emergency number Thurs., Fri., and throughout the weekend, until I finally got a hold of Xtine early Monday morning. I shared her my miserable experience with her, and her response was "" oh. Well, I mean, your bite should go back to the way it was in a couple of days"". ??? It didn't. By the time Dr. Loveless finally returned my call on Weds., yes! Weds., I had vowed to never set foot in his office again. Unfortunately, the worst was yet to come for me. I spent the next 3 1/2 months in excruciating, DEBILITATING pain. Living off of muscle relaxants, hydrocodone( every 5 1/2 hrs) and finally having to succumb to an anti-seizure medication that my GP prescribed off label to help me with the debiltating pain. I did not leave my house for over three months, save for gong to the doctor due to the pain I was in. I couldn't work, spend time with my kids; nothing. I could barely hold my head up on a good day.  Are they nice there? Yes. WHO CARES??? Being nice has nothing to to with being competent in treating TMJ, or anything.  Interestingly enough, he refunded the money I spent on his ""treatment"", but I suspect he did it more to protect himself than anything. He also lied to me about how he knew the prolotherapist my GP referred me to, (to help me with my excruciating pain and TMJD). Oddly enough, what spurred me to write this review, was the fact that Dr.Loveless personally brought my records to the Prolotherapist's office( CYA much?), and wrote misleading, saccharine notes to the next dentist I went to, who consequently said I didn't need any dental work done. One word. Charlatan."
531,"In my lifetime I have had 4 different dentists.  Dr. Patel is by far the best.  Unfortunately I had to have a root canal and crown today for the first time ever.  I was VERY nervous.  However Dr. Patel and his team were very gentle.  I literally felt ZERO discomfort.
The office is state of the art and very relaxing in appearance.  The cost of service was reasonable and he also works with almost every insurance.  I highly recommend Dr. Patel and his team at Metro Smiles!"
532,"I went here for acupuncture a few years ago and it wasn't cool at all. The practitioner didn't take me seriously when I said that a needle at my ankle hurt and felt like it was nicking a nerve. Instead she wiggled it around. I said it still hurt. She wiggled it more and quickly left the room. The other needles were fine (which surprised me) but for the 20 minutes she was out of the room my ankle was throbbing. For the next several days my ankle was aching and it was sore to the touch and had a mark where the needle had been placed. It was about a week later that the residual pain was finally gone and the bruised puncture site had healed. It was a very stressful and disenchanting experience.

The facility seems nice but I do not recommend them for acupuncture at all."
533,"In my first phone call to them I stated that I was 17, having some wisdom tooth pain and that I would just like to have a dentist check them out. Then during my INTAKE APPOINTMENT, before anyone had looked at my teeth, i was told i had a surgery scheduled for next week to remove my wisdom teeth! I said no thank you because no one had even looked at my teeth yet. I'm still confused why the lady on my first phonecall had scheduled a SURGERY so quickly, i wasn't even a patient yet! Presumably the same lady at the front desk was so rude when i first came in. Not very helpful. Then, they were also rude to me when I asked for a doctor to look at my wisdom teeth before I schedule an extraction. I still haven't had them looked at but they just keep on booking surgery appointments for me.
The stress has caused me to have nightmares of this place.

Then just yesterday I was in for a cavity filling. During the first 3 minutes of the dentist giving me a local anesthesia shot, I felt something was wrong and started crying from the pain. When i got up she looked at me, and said that i was swelling up badly. I looked in the mirror and my entire cheek was swollen like a golfball was stuck in it. The appointment was cut short, and when my mom came to pick me up the dentist made a sarcastic remark about my mom being in pajamas from just getting off work! Lol this is the same lady that had just cut my vein with a needle and caused my face to be disfigured. The swelling is called a 'hematoma' and is pretty common in dentistry, but it's the next day and I still can't eat or laugh or brush my teeth because my cheek is so swollen. Not to mention i wont be able to leave the house until it goes down... god knows when? 
So, I still need my cavity filled and wisdom teeth looked at. I wont be coming back here for those things. This place ruined the dentist for me. I was never scared of going to the dentist until now."
534,"I came on Yelp to look for a place with good reviews and at the time, this place had them. I was fairly early to my appointment, so I sat in the waiting area reading a book for a good 30 mins before they were ready for me. I got to observe a lot in those 30 minutes. I sat very uncomfortably watching the pushiest ""sales woman"" in the glasses section. I work in a career field that requires I observe behaviors, so it's something I take an interest in naturally. I watched as this glasses sales lady forced each customer who was on their way out to go through her lion's den in order to get out. You know how museums often force you through a gift shop just so you can get out? This was basically like that. I watched as she very fakely tried to convince customers to buy the most expensive glasses there are. One poor lady sat with her for about 10 minutes and was convinced she had found the perfect glasses, until she found out they were going to cost her over $700, at which point she said she had to discuss with her husband. Ms. Sales lady, not about to lose out on that commission I'm sure, was none too pleased with that response. I watched this happen over and over again until she eventually approached me while I was sitting ""reading"" and told me I should go look at glasses. I politely declined but she pushed. I then informed her that I'm here for contacts because I almost never wear my glasses. Her response was something along the lines of ""Oh, well you'll definitely need new glasses too after you see the Dr., so I'm sure I'll see you soon."". She was pretending to be very friendly but if you know anything about people, you can easily read through her snide comment. Upon finally getting in for my appointment, the first girl who did my eye tests (the scary air test thing, etc) was really nice. Then I got to see the Dr. and she was nice enough. My issue with her was she was pushy as well. She pushed me to try daily contacts and another brand instead of my usual brand, which I told her I had been happily using for years. She sent me on my way with 2 free samples of contacts that I knew I wouldn't buy, and to my despair, I was forced to schedule a follow up appointment. As if things couldn't get worse, on my way out, she led me directly to pushy glasses sales lady. I informed her that I would have to come back and bring someone with me to help me pick out glasses (I had no intention of buying but was intimidated by her that I didn't feel comfortable just saying ""Leave me the f alone!""). She resisted my attempts to leave, but eventually gave in. I got in my car and wanted to cry from my bad experience and knowing I had to go back. I knew I had to mentally prepare myself for my upcoming second appointment the next week.

Next week comes and I arrive prepared this time. I'm going to stand up for myself. I will not buy glasses... I will not buy more expensive contacts that the Dr. wants me to have, and I WILL walk out victorious! Well, kinda. When I got in to see the Dr. I let her know that something didn't seem right with one of the contacts, so we had to adjust the prescription a little. To my surprised, she proceeded to stick her finger in my eye to put the contact in. It was so unexpected and uncomfortable. Imagine someone coming at your eye with their finger without even telling you! I would have much preferred to do it myself. After all was said and done, I told her I didn't want the daily contacts and I wanted to go back to my other brand. She seemed disappointed (less commission?). I also told her I was going to buy them elsewhere as my insurance could get me a discount. No no no she insisted, SHE can get me a discount. A GREAT discount of course. I believed her. I shouldn't have. I have great insurance and I walked out paying over $300 for a contact exam and 6 month supply of contacts. It wasn't over yet, I had to face the sales lady still. I was once again led directly to the sales lady on my way out, as if it wasn't an option not to see her. This time I held my ground and said no, I'm not looking. I will come back at another time if I change my mind. She resisted, but eventually backed down. Success!
As I was paying, they told me to come back to pick up my contacts. I said ""Can't you just mail them to me?"". I was terrified at the idea of coming back a third time! She said ""Oh, yeah, we can"" as if she was surprised I asked. She also didn't want to give me my prescription, I had to specifically ask for it! Never have I walked out of an appointment without being given my prescription. She would however only give me my contacts prescription, not my glasses. Obviously trying to force me to go back THERE to get glasses.
The final straw was when I ordered the next 6 months of contacts online from a different vendor. I entered my prescription and Dr. info, and they wouldn't even respond to this other company to confirm my prescription! They are required by law to give your prescription! Biggest regret ever going here!"
535,"I have had horrific period pain for several years now, which has sent me to the ER several times. Exasperated and feeling like I'd tried everything outside of surgery, I went to see Dr. Silverberg af the Texas Fertility Center upon the recommendation of my gynecologist.

On my first visit, which began as a consultation in his office, I was quickly ushered in by his nurse and told he would be in soon to see me. After a few minutes, the door burst open, he gregariously shook my hand, plopped down in his seat, kicked back with his hands behind his head, and asked for a brief background on who I was and why I was there to see him. While this was a bit of an abrupt entry, I was hopeful by his initial warm demeanor that we would have a good rapport. I began to share  why I was there, and he started interrupting with questions to seemingly hurry along my own story. I felt rushed and flustered as I was trying to remember all the important points I wanted to tell him. (Mind you, I have an undergrad and masters degree in communication, so I'm pretty mindful and practiced on succinct and to-the-point messaging).

When we started discussing my symptoms, he diagnosed endometriosis, sight-unseen. He then proceeds to slap a huge textbook down in front of me, flips to a certain chapter, and points to the author of the chapter, himself. ""See there? I LITERALLY WROTE the chapter on how to do endometriosis surgery"" insinuating that it would be foolish not to do this surgery with him. I began to ask some questions about the procedure, and he immediately cut me off - shushing me and putting his index finger in front of him to stop me, actually telling me to wait until he was finished talking. He continued talking about how many surgeries he's done, how successful they've been, and how mine would go. I had never been shushed by a doctor in my entire life.

This potentially being the first surgery I would ever have, and in a very sensitive area, I wanted to know as much as I could to make sure I was making the right decision. On my next visit I asked about alternatives to surgery, which he did not offer on his own accord, and he said the only other alternatives were serious (and severe) hormonal birth control methods to essentially kill the endometriosis. I told him that my body has reacted horribly to some of those options in the past, and that that wasn't an option for me. He did not offer another alternative when I asked for one. 

This second visit was one of the most rushed visits I've ever had with a medical professional, and I've seen plenty. I came into an exam room and was asked to undress by the nurse/put a gown on. He rushed in and performed an ultrasound and then said we were all set for surgery. I had several questions that I'd forgotten to ask at my first appointment, so I began asking them. His responses to my questions were given in rapid-fire; it was clear that he didn't feel like he had the time to answer them. I was stunned and angered that he gave me so little time to get more information and ask questions before such an important surgery. This appointment lasted maybe 5-7 minutes, which included the ultrasound.

Upon recounting this second negative experience to my boyfriend-at-the time, now-husband, he felt like Silverberg was intent on selling me on the surgery, with no regard to my actual situation. 

I ended up having the surgery, thinking it was the only option I had left that might decrease my pain. Silverberg told me that many of his patients have little-to-no recovery time; that one time he'd seen a patient either the same night or the night after out at an Austin restaurant having dinner at the same place he was. He shrugged his shoulders at my concerns saying the recovery - and surgery - was no big deal.

My recovery was pretty darn painful and took WAY longer than he led me to believe. Just the effects of the general anesthesia alone didn't wear off for two weeks; I didn't feel normal until then, and even then, I still had pain from the surgery continue after that. 

And here's the kicker. It did NOTHING for my period pain. In fact, my pain GOT WORSE after the surgery. And not just for the first or second period, like they said could happen, but every month. I'm not even sure now that my pain is due to endometriosis.

I should have listened to my now-husband. I had a feeling deep-down each time I interacted with Silverberg that he was never really listening to me; that I was never heard as his patient. It was a painful and serious surgery, information he downplayed, not to mention incredibly expensive - even with insurance, and it did nothing to help my chronic, debilitating pain. 

Think twice, or at least try to get a second or third opinion (he was my second) before you agree to an endometriosis laparoscopy with Silverberg."
536,"DR: That's quite the shiner you got there!  I heard you hit the handle bars. No?  Over the handlebars!  I tell you what; I just saw this one bike race.  Man!  One guy didn't even get up.  Helicopter'ed him out of there.  Total unresponsive.  

DR: Check out this flash light here, look at it.  Relax.  Breathe.  I'm gonna touch you.  Nothing weird.  Lift your shirt.  

DR: Yeah those muscles between them ribs is like [[holds fingers up in a criss-cross fashion]] little Chinese finger-traps in there. You're going to be in pain for a few more days.  I'm going to give you these pills; one is a muscle relaxer, and the other is for during the day.  Don't get 'em mixed up.  

DR: The day time one?

DR: Better.  Than.  Codeine.  

DR: I took these after I fractured some ribs a few years back and felt so good that I fractured a few more and didn't notice; so be careful.  Take one?  Stop the pain of a bullet.  Take two?  Goes even farther! So don't push it with your workouts.  I mean you won't. feel.  a THING!

DR: Wanna hear a football story?!  So I.... (continues)

(20 minutes later)

DR: ...and that's how I got my first truck!

DR: Don't worry about the day one making you drowsy or loopy. Like you think you take one and go out and you're going to be all weird.  It's cool.  I've been taking them all day.


[I am serious, and seriously in love with this doctor.  I will definitely go back]."
537,"Probably the only one star review you'll find of this place, but it is mine. I had my procedure done in October 2019. Was promised the same as all the others here, but apparently I had a much different outcome. It seems that everyone has great vision the next day, and I have to admit it was better and I could see without glasses (and I still can). However, my vision was (and still is) blurry. Went in for my follow up the next day and the doctor said everything looked great. Went in for my 30 day follow up (which was unheard of from my friends who had lasik) and the doctor said everything looked great and my blurry vision would go away...I'd just probably need the 6 months to heal. 

6 months down the road, still the same. So I contacted LasikPlus again on 05/29. They said they'd get my note to the doctors and have someone follow up with me. Today is 06/29 and no doctors have followed up with me. I've never had blurry vision until my lasik procedure. 

Here are the hoops I now need to jump through for any further assistance: https://www.lasikplus.com/enhancementprocess/. 

So, after I spend more money on a comprehensive dilated eye examination that includes a cycloplegic refraction, have an ophthalmologist complete the Laser Vision Retreatment Evaluation Form, wait 3 business days for the form to be processed, then wait another 15 days for a medical staff to review the form, and IF and ONLY IF they feel that a retreatment may be a viable option for me, then I get to spend another $75 for a LasikPlus comprehensive exam to determine if I'm eligible to have retreatment. 

It's very frustrating living life with blurry vision, especially with a desk job, staring at a monitor 40+ hours a week. So I have that now, and a $4000+ bill that I'm still paying off. They really got me with the ""free lifetime advantage program"" and the ""we're a one trick pony and we do it best"" speeches. Epic regret."
538,"DO NOT send your loved one here.   My elderly father was terribly neglected.  We are also reporting the situation to Medicare because we suspect Medicare fraud.  

He was disabled by a stroke.  He was left in bed most days according to him, our observations and our aid who was there almost all day - only taken out once to have his pajamas changed and put back in bed rather than having therapy 3 hours per day, 5 days a week as they claim and as their records state.  He seems far weaker than when he started.  I guess they figured that he would be too old and we were too dumb to notice the neglect and lack of therapy.

We finally got him transferred.  His feet are in terrible shape from neglect.  He did not have his teeth or hair brushed for almost two weeks.  Our aide said, the nurse would say she'd be back in 10 minutes, and then 10 more minutes, and then eventually . . it was forgotten.  When I thought he was getting sick, I finally found a nurse who assured me she or someone else would call . . . no call.  (I would have been shocked if they had called by that point).  I saw her again and she told me she forgot and had no idea what I was talking about.  

I have talked to others in this industry and found out that this place has a terrible reputation.  The nurses seem like zombies, they do not look you in the eye, there is no compassion, no accountability . . .  no one will introduce themselves, in fact, you will have no idea who the nurse is (you could be there hours and never see anyone), they frequently do not respond to calls for help (if they do it is as much as an hour or more later).  

Senior management does not return calls either.  So - no one at the top or bottom seems to care.  

Incompetent, lazy, overworked, understaffed, apathetic, all about profit, whatever you want to call it, this place is a terrible reflection on humanity and, as another reviewer said, probably worse than hell on Earth.  Exactly the opposite of what you and your family  need when you are in a crisis.

PS  Great places in Atlanta for rehab do exist!  We've seen it and we are in one now!!!"
539,"Updating my review because I finally pulled the trigger and booked my procedure! Life got in the way, and over two years later went back to Dr. Walden's office for another consultation. Still blown away by the professionalism of Dr. Walden and her staff. Will update again following my procedure in February."
540,"I have been in this clinic in the Mother Joseph Building by Providence St. Vincent quite a bit. The parking garage is a  freaking nightmare. Once you get through THAT, the front desk and clinic staff are super nice though. Appointments tend to run exactly on time. Love that!

My nearly 87 year old father moved to Oregon ( after a divorce at 80 from the stepmonster....yeah that really happened) bringing his  hypermedically focused ( Dr appointments are a fun outing for him) post quintuple bypass surgery self and his inflated expectations that I would manage his healthcare with him. Sigh. Yeah. I'm it. My brother doesnt speak to him. Our Dad is...er...challenging. 

I had been to the ER once  a long time ago with chest pain ( stress) and seen Dr. Jean Phillips and she was funny and kind and sharp. So I took my dad in to see her too. He's a big  inappropriate , bawdy flirt and she thinks he's a funny charming character so that has totally worked out. She's so cool that when she spotted my Queen Bee Bag she said ""NO way!"" And ran out to grab her identical- to -mine bag from her desk to show it to me. What cardiac goddess DOES that? Well. She does. 

We have a Queen Bee bond now. 

The nurses and OHSU residents have all been great with my Dad. At this point his heart and lung functions are pretty limited so it's about keeping him comfortable, five years and like twenty trips to the hospital ago he had 6 months to live...as much as a cranky Walter Matthau meets those old muppet guys in the balcony crochety old dude  COULD be comfortable. They've achieved the comfortable part. Hes on quite a cocktail but as you can tell, hes tenacious. 

My ex had a heart attack recently and went to the same clinic for followup on his stent and medications. He liked the doctor and the clinic. He doesnt usually like anything medical. Hes pretty pissed he had a heart attack but very satisfied with his medical care. 

Today was my turn. My chest bothered me a few weeks back and given my ex's recent thing, my DNA, and the stress Im under I went to the er. They didnt find anything but I had to follow up, too. Dr Phillips isnt available till September ( shes super busy) so I saw Dr.James Gregg Beckerman who was really nice and efficient.His assistant was lovely. ( she remembered me from my Dad's appointments).  My ekg etc was all good. I liked that they gowned me for the ekg but let me get dressed before meeting the doctor for the first time.  Much more dignified. Lucky me, now I get to go have a stress test just to make sure I am ok. Yay. 

Despite my lack of enthusiasm ( those tests are not super fun) , given the number of peeps I take care of , I will do that. This clinic really has been very reasonable with my dad's care and my ex's. I think they're good people. If you have to see a cardiologist on the west side this is a good choice. 

Just watch the parking garage. It's like a driver's ed movie in there."
541,"I ended up with a blood clot in my leg due to post surgery and found myself having to spend the night at the hospital. I've never had to stay at the hospital so I had no idea what to expect. I didn't have anything with me and I was a little stressed about that.

I felt pretty stranded, really. I have to say, the nurses and staff were excellent to work with. All of them. Very caring and compassionate and some with great sense of humors. They did a great job of making me feel comfortable. They came by quite often to monitor me which actually tired me out so I didn't get much rest. I sleep pretty lightly, anyway.

As far as essentials that I didn't have, they had everything I needed to get by. Toothpaste, brush, etc.. The only thing I was really missing was my android cord :)

The food wasn't very good. The fruit even tasted a little plastic. I tried not to eat much while I was there. The best was the pudding and applesauce the nurses gave me.

The only negative I had was with the transport. I had a leg injury along with the clot and was never able to get transport to arrive even after waiting 15+ minutes.I tried using them twice. Once when I was being admitted and the second when I was leaving.   I gave up waiting and ended up walking even with the pain."
542,"staff was nice, but BEWARE for excessive charges! i dont even think they called the insurance company. for a tooth extraction and sedation i was charged 480. but i was smart enough to call my insurance company, got codes from oral place and found out i was covered at a certain percentage. the lady their told me, well ur insurance needs to send us something telling us that??!! ummm what? dont u guys call? her answer was yea, they usually dont cover for sedation for a front tooth. well then duh, find out before you charge me money!!! i worked hard for that. when they decided to actually call...by bill came out to 150. CALL AND VERIFY THRU YOUR INSURANCE GUYS!!!"
543,"I tried on THREE SEPARATE OCCASIONS to schedule a root canal with this company because they took my dental insurance. First it was, ""Oh, we are booked for February, we'll get you in in March but we can't schedule it yet."" Then it was, ""Oh, yes, we still can't schedule you an appointment in March despite it only being two weeks away, here let me write your name down and we'll call you when appointments open up for booking."" Then today, it was, ""Oh, sorry, we are booked solid for March. Maybe we can get you in in April.""

My tooth has been broken for MONTHS and ALL I WANT is for someone to take my damn money from me.

Ridiculously unprofessional. I am furious. Strongly recommend against."
544,It takes 30 to 60 minutes on hold to reach a human being by phone at Rebound.  The physicians and staff are top notch.  The problem is trying to reach them.  There are no emails and no direct numbers.  Everyone goes through reception.   The insurance companies and occupational therapists wait a long time for feedback.
545,"Terrible customer service. Hold times are INSANE and you need one separate appointment for EACH symptom you have in order for anyone to actually pay attention to you. Front desk is usually empty or they make you wait so you're absolutely sure to acknowledge how busy that one agent is! They'll make you wait 30-90 minutes for an agreed upon appointment time but cancel your appointment if you're 12 minutes late and you let them know you'll be late- before leaving your office, letting you drive in the rain and traffic, just to say too bad, but you can wait indefinitely and we MIGHT be able to squeeze you in today?
Dr. Gibson talks too much- and what's worse is she talks over patients, without regard to their symptoms and is very condescending. It's her way or no way, regardless of what YOU are there for because she knows best. 
Dr. Hamilton is judgmental and rude. He rudely said I used the word anxious too much after 40 seconds of me telling him my symptoms worried me! Dr. Rasmussen is hasty and hurtful. He yanked on my hair after hearing about my extreme tenderheadness and concerning hair loss, told me a large infected pore was a freckle after refusing to give it a second glance, and basically told me not bathing was the only cure to my dry, itchy, rashy skin? Dr. Amadi is ok but also rushed and less than thorough. Dr. Ramirez is better at listening and more thorough but not as available. You're looking at a week or two wait to see him. And finally, Dr. Pitmann is the best and most thorough but not at this clinic full time. 
I know seeing only one doctor would help, but the main reason I chose ARC was because of their ""same-day"" appointments, network of doctors and specialists, and after hour clinic. I thought this would make them more convenient and accessible but boy was I mistaken! The doctors don't talk to each other and most don't read about your other visits. Same day appointments DO NOT EXIST here, regardless of what they advertise! Instead they push you to after hours clinic just to tack on an additional 30 dollar fee! Since most of the doctors are less than ideal, referrals (which are necessary from most insurances) are not given unless ARC has squeezed enough of your time, persistence, and money for them to deem you ""eligible"" to see a specialist. My record has been at least 3-5 visits for the same symptoms spread out for at least 4-6 months for ONE referral. As if taking time off from work to see a doctor about making an appointment just to see another doctor isn't wasteful enough!"
546,"I physically saw this office when I went to a dentist appoitment. However it seems to just be a ""hoax"" now. I have emailed them several times and have called. Everytime I have called there is NEVER an answer, I have left 6 voicemails for someone to call me to set up an appoitment and never received a return call. Never received a email back either......just weird!!!! Its like it is some type of ""front buisness""."
547,"Update - This appt was for a serious thing - I'm concerned, my family is concerned for me, and now I can lose days calling my insurance and trying to find another doctor.  I wonder how this loss in time will manifest in my body.  

My doctor was great, unfortunately I have to lose the privilege of having him be my doctor because this facility operates ILLOGICALLY, and do you want illogical people to be responsible for your health? 

1 - they mixed up my records, gave me the information for someone else's test results.

2 - I was scheduled with the wrong doctor because of this

3 - I called for a specific procedure, for which they made an appointment, and then told me I couldn't have, AFTER I arrived, filled out all the info, and went to the room, and then they asked me go back up front. All these hours wasted from work, will they cover the cost? 

They require a consultation they said. I don't understand why they let me make the appointment if that's the case. Why not tell me that when I called for the appointment? 

4 - I asked for a doctor's note, which they said they couldn't give me because I wasn't seen. Wow. Thanks. That makes sense, right? To deny me that?  I just want to show that I came in for a scheduled procedure. 

They ended up giving me a form that said ""this patient will reschedule."" Why would I reschedule with an office like this? 

Kelsey at the front desk was lovely though. 

I need to check my records to make sure the mixup didn't also cause them to bill me incorrectly."
548,"One of the worst I've had.  I presented with an ongoing, unresolved GYN issue.   Dr. P remarked that the symptoms were significant so she obtained lab cultures.  When the med tech called to tell me that the cultures were negative, there was no plan to follow up with Dr. P even though I reported that the symptoms persisted (over the previous several months).   So I asked what Dr P recommended.  She put me on hold and then returned, telling me to ""douche"" for 3 days.  Seriously.  No exploration of further causes. On to the next patient.

Since they blew me off, I took it upon myself to research the symptom I was having to find that while it is usually due to some sort of pathogen (ones they tested for), it could also be related to abnormal cell growth ie. cancer!  FYI...although my Pap Smear result was negative, I just happen to have a history of CANCER. 

So, because I'm very proactive, I asked for my own referral to see a OBGYN (Dr. Thoppil, Riverplace OBGYN...5 stars all the way around) who IMMEDIATELY  nailed down the most likely etiologies (one of the meds I'm taking). He then scheduled me for the appropriate diagnostic procedure to rule out cancer or polyps (waiting for pathology reports...probably not cancer, thankfully).

Needless to say, I'm changing my primary care doctor.  Dr. Kevin Spencer is in the same network but he's got rave YELP reviews.  Going to see him on Mon."
549,"Dr Scott Boone is wonderful with his patient care and I trust his opinion. However, it's near impossible to get ahold of anyone through phone. I was told by Jessica Auffant at my last well woman in February 2016 that if I changed my mind from the birth control pill, all I had to do was call the office and have them order an IUD, and then they would follow up with me to make the appointment. For the past 6months I tried calling. I was told I need to speak with medical records. I was transferred each time (if I ever even got through, sometimes the phone would ring for 5 minutes and I would give up) to medical records, but the lady was always ""out to lunch"" and I left her several voicemails. She returned my call ONCE while I was at work and left a vague voice message. I called her back that night but of course the office was closed so I couldn't even leave her a message after hours. So, one day I had off work, I decided to just drive to the office and speak with someone. Once again, I was told that the lady who works medical records was out to lunch. I offered to wait and was told she just left and could be another hour. The lady who helped me took my name down and wrote ""urgent"". Decided to go finish my errands for the day and I called the office again two hours later. No answer. This was over a month ago and I haven't received a call back. At this point, I'm due for my well woman exam again. I know they only do ""one thing per visit"" for example, placing the IUD would need to be a separate visit from the well woman. Now I have to cram two appointments into the following next two months. I wanted to do this 6 months again during the summer when I wasn't so busy. I don't want to switch offices but at this point I literally cannot even get an appointment. I can't imagine if I were pregnant, trying to make my checkup appointments! That time will be soon for me and I'm thinking about doing some research for other OBGYNs near by."
550,"We live in a society of instant gratification.  In medicine, this instant gratification frequently takes the form of easy to procure prescription drugs.  Well my friends, this is not the case at the CVS Minute Clinic.

For the best possible experience, walk in there knowing your body, knowing what disease you have, and knowing the best way to kill it.  Then, be prepared to fight tooth and nail for your prescription.  

Of course, I did not take this advice.  I walked in pretty sure that I had an ear infection, and two days later, I'm pretty sure I still have the same ear infection because all I got was a prescription for some numbing ear drops instead of the antibiotic I needed.  

There was about an hour wait to see the Nurse Practitioner on a Sunday morning, and she sped through the seven patients ahead of me pretty quickly.  Expect to spend about 10 minutes in the examining room.  For a quick medical visit like mine, you can expect to pay $62 if your insurance does not cover it (mine did).  However, considering I'll probably need a follow up visit to my regular doc in the next couple of days, this is not really the bargain it seems.

The only upside?  Well, they don't weigh you so you can continue to live in ignorant bliss from the effects of all the ""sick"" food you've been eating.  Mmm, chicken noodle soup, fruit smoothies, Italian ice....yum."
551,"This is a continuous review of the previous one:

Final Chapter: Conclusions, Concerns, and questions
.
As I mentioned before, my rating for Boston Laser 90% of it is the result of the surgery. The service is not too bad but keep in mind that they have a lot of clients and staffs so you know how those clinic functions. Every time you go, you will have a different person helping you. That is why I said the staff in blue instead of the staff name. Some of them are assistants and some of them are doctors. The only way to tell the difference is to look at their name tag I suppose. Here are some facts and questions I can think of to help answer with my personal result. I had a minor halo during night times for first few weeks. I started experience eye dry after few weeks, strange isn't it. But it is just minor dryness. The most time I had minor dry eyes when waking up in the morning. Parking? They have meter street parking for max of two hours. Normally it is enough time to finish what you doing there unless you are late ofc. How much does it cost in Boston Lasik? I will say between 3k~7k base on what you have. The deciding factor will be insurance, referrals, student of some sort or some sort of third party with discount. For details please contact them. Oh and I don't have red eye until few days later with a minor red strip on my eyes, I guess I am pretty lucky! Or perhaps the god had answered my friends' prayers. Either way if you have any questions or concerns regarding Lasik or consider doing Lasik at Boston Lasik, feel free to message me. For a 100% most satisfy, I will say I am 96.79% satisfy from Boston Laser. That's a 5 stars right?
Last not least, why am I writing this long ass detailed story review? Well before I did the surgery I am the kind of person who wants to read as much material regarding Lasik as possible or to know as much as I can and now I've done it I want to help those who are consider doing Lasik but also scare of it like me out! I didn't put much of technical stuff here because you can find those elsewhere. I simply added my own experience here as much as I can think of right now and hope it will help some of you out there, I hope this helps and best of luck out there guys, peace!"
552,"Terrible service. waited in the ER for 6 hours and never saw a doctor. Went into the ER dry heaving unable to keep any water down from food poisoning. I had been throwing up all day and had nothing left in my body (why I couldn't keep any water down or receive an IV) which is what I told my nurse. At this point, I was dangerously dehydrated drinking water to try to absorb anything before I threw it up. I asked a nurse for saltine crackers before receiving the IV but said she couldn't give me anything until a doctor had seen me. I then threw up water for 6 hours in a hallway bed begging the nurse for a pack of crackers. I tried to stay as long as I could to receive an IV until I couldn't take it anymore and had to be picked up by a friend to bring me to a convenience store to get something in my stomach. stopped dry heaving minutes after but the damage to my stomach had already been done. Could have gotten an IV six hours earlier if she would have gotten me a pack of crackers to stop the dry heaving. Nurse probably didn't even notice I left."
553,"If you're looking for a piercing... pick this place. 
Cash only for piercings (ATM inside)
I was in Orlando for two weeks and decided to get 3 piercings done within a week. Billy was very professional and calm. Very detailed about cleaning and healing process. He made my husband and I feel good we came here to such a clean place. 
Thank you so much!"
554,"I have been a patient for many years with providence Scholls medical and never had any problems. I have been going there a lot lately for medical stuff and the front desk lady (I am not sure what her name is but she has dark hair) is the most unprofessional person I know. I work in a medical field and our number 1 thing is patient care. That lady is always acting like she is busy on the computer with something and her main sentence is ""I'll be right with you"" while the other ladies are with other patients checking them in. Not once have I been helped by her or checked in. I don't care what you are doing on the computer but it should be dropped and taken care of a patient 1st the computer stuff can wait. The front desk People should greed patients with a smile and positive attitude to give the whole office and the whole building positive reviews. She is always looking mad and never willing to help. Maybe she needs another job where she does not communicate with other people. RIDICULOUS!"
555,"It is totally frustrating dealing with this company. We initially talked with someone in the Houston office, not realizing that they weren't in Austin. They said they would mail supplies, but nothing happened for two weeks.  When called back, they again said they would mail them. Still nothing. It took several phone calls to finally have just the tubing for the CPAP mailed! We need to find another CPAP supply business!"
556,After wearing glasses for over 25 years I wanted a change. After multiple positive reviews from co workers I made an appointment to see Dr. Vargas. I checked out the website and notified the $2500 special.  After the initial consultation I decided it would be a good investment for me. I could not be happier with results or the great treatment I received from Dr. Vargas and her staff.
557,"Called this afternoon for our mother who is in excruciating pain and likely in need of an extraction or at least a prescription for antibiotics so her swelling can be reduced. The receptionist was confused about our phone number as since we kept our numbers from when we moved to Boston from Los Angeles (even asking if we were calling from Boston). We were told we would receive a call back shortly (we had no appointment, but were hoping to been seen due to the emergency nature of the call) but never got a call. Called back twice and was hung up on each time after the first ring. I understand if we can't be seen due to the short notice, but answer your phone and say so. Don't hide behind your caller ID. Maybe set up an appointment for us for the upcoming week. What an extremely childish way to run a business. Typical dentist, just in it for the money, not for the care of patients in need. DO NOT GO HERE"
558,"Well, it's not really a walk in.  You can go in and make an appointment and come back 2 hours later I'm not sure why they still call these places walk in clinics. The doctor I saw had no bedside manor, rather robotic. It took a very long time to get things across to The counter staff.

And my absolute favourite thing was $31.50 for a generic printed doctors note for work that was not even signed, just stamped."
559,"I just left this place in a worse condition than I came in. I have debilitating panic attacks and anxiety. My psychiatrist is currently switching me to another medication and the new medication isn't controlling my anxiety or panic attacks. 

Long story short I had an 11 hour panic attack today. Since my doctor's office isn't open on the weekends I decided to wait it out. When it didn't go away I decided to go to the clinic. Big mistake. 

When I got there the doctor basically told me that I shouldn't have come in, that he could see that I'd been there recently (I hadn't. I'd been there some months prior when I had another panic attack. I'd only been to this clinic twice in my life). He then proceeded to tell me that he refused to give me a prescription for adivan which I never asked for in the first place. Then he berated me for about 10 minutes telling me that I am possibly just withdrawing because most people don't know how to take medicine for panic attacks properly. 

My husband who is a social worker got furious and tried to argue with him. I told my husband to calm down and informed the doctor that I'd been sober for 6 years and am aware of addiction issues that certain medicines can cause. He just continued to basically call me a drug seeker, told me that I poorly manage my anxiety, that I shouldn't come to the emergency room when I have a panic attack, and very condescendingly told me that my panic attacks weren't even a big deal because they weren't life threatening. 

The plus in all this was that the nurse there was extremely kind. When I had a nervous break down because of now the doctor was treating me she closed the door and talked to me telling me that I hadn't done anything wrong coming there. I truly appreciate her being there in that moment. 

I can honestly say that I've never felt this low in my life regarding my mental illness. I've struggled with it my whole life and I've always been proactive about getting help for it when I need it. This was the first time I encountered someone in the medical field who reacted towards it with contempt and disdain.  I've never been treated so horribly by anyone. I'm still in shock that this even happened. 

Do not go to this clinic if you have mental health issues. Please, for the sake of your own mental health seek help elsewhere."
560,"I was so, so, so stressed out when I came here.  You know those times when you are so stressed out, you can't concentrate on anything?  You can't make small talk?  Many things in this world are hard and stressful, and one of those things (for me) is the entire month of April during my first year of graduate school.  On Patriot's Day, I became obsessed with the idea of getting a massage THAT VERY SECOND OR I WILL DIE, and called around until I found a place that would take me.  

Why I would recommend Hands-On Health:
1. I was able to get a same-day appointment here.  Can't do that most places.
2. As mentioned before, when I'm under lots of stress, I completely lose my ability to pay attention/make small talk with any degree of competency.  I was so frazzled, I have no idea what my massage therapist's name was (too bad, because she was really good).  They were really nice about my tense, nervous energy and polluting their pleasant establishment, which I appreciated.  
3. Very good pressure during the massage (and I like pressure a lot.  Good pain, baby, bring on the good pain).  
4. Nice massage therapist.  Did not try to yap at me, but kindly answered my many technical questions (aka ""Why is that tense?""  ""What is the name of that muscle?"") to the satisfaction of my random-information-collecting brain.  
5. I was a competitive swimmer for most of my life, and by the time I quit, I had some really weird mess going on with my shoulder and back due to overuse. It seems that lately, whenever I get stressed, the old injury flares up again - it's pretty annoying/painful.  My therapist was great about getting EVERY LITTLE trigger point out, leaving me so relaxed and pain free. When I walked out, I noticed my shoulders were riding about 3 inches lower than before.  Hallelujah!  Anyways, if you suffer from sports injuries (especially overuse injuries) this place seems really great for that kind of massage. 
6. When I went back to the office, my friend and colleague exclaimed, ""Your face looks so different!  You look so relaxed!""  My therapist had done something with my face during the massage to make it calm down, and so it looks like I might even avoid the whole ""pinched old woman"" look for a couple more years.
7. It's not too expensive - and there's a student discount. 
8. I felt great two days and even three days after (I'm usually pretty sore).

Potential Problems:
1. My massage started late (about 15 minutes or so late).  It wasn't a problem for me at all (I had plenty of time), but I feel obligated to let the Yelp community know.
2. I still paid $60 for someone to rub my back for 45 minutes.  Yes, it was worth it, yes, that's a good deal, but yes, that is still quite a bit of money to me.

All in all, a great place."
561,"PLEASE, PLEASE, PLEASE Stay away from the Arboretum LensCrafters. Casandra is the worst professional I've been around in a LONG time. 

My purpose for visiting was to simply exchange my frames.  That's not asking much, yet the staff was so rude, condescending , disgusting, and illhearted that bad customer service has reached a new low for me. First, Casandra told me ""NO"" I couldn't exchange or return them because of a small scratch on the side of the frame.  Then as I told her how i've had them less than a week, she rolls her eyes and said: ""There are company 'Policies,' and our Policy isn't to accept any damaged goods! NOW.. For Customer satisfaction I'll let you exchange them, but I'm letting you know, I'm doing you a huge favor, and I don't have to do this."" This badgering went on and on until I walked away. 

I thought she was so rude that I left and went to the Barton Creek LensCrafters. However, they were night and day nicer, especially the Manager Robin and Sarah.  I explained to them what happened and they looked at the scratch and said it looked like a drill mount scratch, but that didn't even matter... The staff at Barton Creek helped me out so much. If you live up north make the short drive to them!"
562,"Just finished my first float (60 mins).  I've talked to several people that have done floats (elsewhere) before, and 2 of them LOVE IT!!!  I was excited to try it!  

I have to say tho, I think I'm a take it or leave it person about the floating thing.  I mean, if it was free, I'd totally go for the Epsom Salt exposure.  But I also really enjoy my home made-spa-epsom salt-essential oils baths just as much if not more.  Yeah, I'm not 'floating' at home, but I can also make the water warmer at home (which i love and find very therapeutic).  The water temperature in the float wasn't cold, but it wasn't warm either...  it basically felt neutral.  I was surprised to find myself feeling a little bit nervous about crawling into this 'tank' when I first saw it... and shutting the door behind me???  But I just proceeded, mind over matter, and it was not problem. The smell was a little funky... but that faded soon.  I don't know, I just didn't really zen out beyond what I would already do in a hot bath, or the infrared-sauna I go to at Anisha/r3 Health on Hawthorne, or during/after a great thai massage.  So for me, I'd prefer to spend money on those things before a float. 

What I did really enjoy was sitting in and relaxing in the steam room & sauna afterwards!!!  And I'd love to check out the hot tub come winter time! 

I was a little nervous when I realized the Everett House was co-ed/clothing optional & that I had failed to book my appointment on a women only day.  I'm not prude, but I'm also not a nudist that is comfortable walking around naked in front of men I don't know.  If I went on a women's only day, it would have been perfect! (note to self in the future).   I just didn't know what to expect, so I decided to wear a swimsuit and i was glad I did.  Because other than 3 bathrooms (where you could dress in private) there is no privacy during co-ed hours: the showers are open, the dressing areas are open...  And for the record, it wasn't horrible going during co-ed hours, as long as you are not shocked (or get over yourself being a little shocked) when naked men walk into the sauna uncovered with even a towel, and it's only you and them.  But everyone was polite enough and I just told myself to get over any ingrained American puritan hang ups.   My only complaint: I thought the rules said everyone, naked or in clothing, was suppose to take a towel into the sauna/steam rooms to sit/lay on.  One naked fellow was not following those rules.  So I just had to reassure myself that as long as I had my towel to sit on, I didn't need to stress about the hygiene of it all (oh & I avoided sitting where they had just been hang out... 

In summary: I might give floating another try sometime, but I'm super geeked out on it.  But I would return to Everette House to use the steam/sauna on a women's only day, or just go with my husband next time."
563,"I've had numerous massages over the course of my life, but John has become my go-to. What sets him apart from many other therapists is that he genuinely cares about your body getting better. Like visits to a doctor, the idea is NOT to keep you coming back week after week feeling sick. The idea is to get you healed and to keep you healthy. Every visit to John is met with a welcoming ""How have you been feeling?""

What you need to know before seeing John is that although his work is remarkably effective, therapeutic massage works best when it's a team effort. From your very first appointment, John steps in like a coach, confident and enthusiastic about winning the game, but making it very clear that it just ain't gonna happen if you're moseying around the sidelines. He offers tips and recommendations after every visit. I guess you could call that ""training"", right?

Aside from being an expert in his craft, John has a great, easygoing personality. He is very adaptable and attentive when it comes to making your therapy session comfortable and relaxing. In my case, I'm on the quieter side but I love listening to people talk, and John always has some funny stories to tell. It makes my sessions more pleasant when I'm laughing between the more intense strokes. 

Excerpt from my internal dialogue:
""Hahaha... that's a really... (DAHHhhhhh!!)... funny story about... (Owwww, that feels awesome!!)... your cat... (Gahhh, oh lordy!)... hahaha...""

Anyway, my body's felt so much better since I started seeing him. If you're looking for an effective and deep massage, see John."
564,"From one person who struggled with fertility issues and multiple miscarriages.... If I could give Sage Acupuncture 10 stars, I would!
Sadie was my first practitioner at Sage, and Michelle Gonzales did almost all my treatments for most of my pregnancy. Everyone I met and had experience with was amazing, but those are my two go-to's, especially Michelle. 
When I met Sadie, I was immediately at ease. She took so much time to really get to know me, my history, and complete a treatment my first visit. She was (and is) obviously well-versed in both Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) and western medicine, and made it clear that the approach is integrative. They aren't trying to overtake any M.D. or other western approaches or treatments; rather, they are working to make you as healthy and as ready for pregnancy (or whatever your issue) as possible, AND lay the groundwork for any western treatment (meds like Clomid, or an IUI, or IVF) to be fully effective. 
This practice is a compassionate, efficient, workhorse of knowledge that significantly improved my life. I went to them to feel better after three miscarriages and then two rounds of Clomid + IUI, to sort of cleanse my system. But, with the goal of eventually getting pregnant. Again. I had two other healthy kiddos, by the way. I struggled getting pregnant with the first, but not like this. By that point, though, I was pretty resigned to the fact that another biological child may not be in the cards for us, and just wanted to be nice to my body. I started on all the herbs they recommended, and went to acupuncture twice a week. There may have been residual Clomid in my system, and maybe it was just time, but I was pregnant about three weeks later. And it stuck! That's the biggest deal. They had gotten me off caffeine, which seemed impossible, built up my body, and honestly, I had never felt better. It may have been the twice-weekly nap sessions (because I *always* dozed while receiving my treatments), but whatever it was, I felt amazing.
My baby is now 8 months old, and I wish I could go in twice a week for a nap! :-) I really do need to get back, though.
Here are more details: Michelle Gonzales is an amazing practitioner, like Sadie. I'm sure they all are, but she's my go-to, as I said. She has more knowledge in her little pinky than I could hope to learn in a lifetime of Chinese herbs, TCM, effective points, AND a dabble in western medicine. Or, at least, the desire to understand and integrate it all. Michelle is a delightful person, but I really want to underscore that her treatments are effective. I really felt what we were trying to achieve each session. Also, I am over 40yo, and was when I got pregnant with our last baby. I am also a part-time student and full-time mom, which is very stressful at times. They helped with anxiety around busy weeks with school/tests & grad school applications, and with allergies when those popped up. So, I had a one-stop shop for everything during my pregnancy. I also saw my OB/GYN, of course, for prenatal care, and she was supportive of my acupuncture treatments. I did get induced with this last baby, and although acupuncture didn't kick labor into full gear by my induction day, the induction went VERY smoothly (no pain meds, even!) because they had spent several treatments getting my body ready for labor & delivery. And the induction day was sort of my choice; I think if I had let it go a little longer, my body would have kicked into gear without issue.
Sage is truly amazing. Go here for amazing care, and to be well. Even if fertility/pregnancy/etc. isn't your goal, they will take care of you."
565,For 19 years I went to Dr. WHELLERS office to be seen by the PA who I could not say more good things about. On occassions I would get Dr. Wheller who I have never liked because he always had a very short I don't have time for you and pay me now personality. Point here is I go in and he sees me and diagnosed me with walking pneumonia. Gives me antibiotics that don't do anything.  2 wks later still sick weak fever coughing. I call and they wait all day and he does not call back. I should come in again. Tell them too sick and to give me antibiotics and go for CAT scan. Never calls me and I get results pneumonia with fluid around heart. Week 3 end of week call and ask to talk to wheller. Want to be admitted to hospital and bypass er. He has one of his peeps call me back. Wheller says go to er. Never takes the time to follow up with me. Week 4 still coughing.weak. wheller is only interested in taking your money. Beware.
566,"Update:
It must have been a long conference because I called over a period of at least two weeks. I don't recall you trying to contact us during that period or since.

Yes, we do know that policies have many variations. Both my wife and I work in insurance. I retired from the Texas Department of Insurance, including two years managing the health insurance complaints staff. The state of Texas Health Select plan is a very common one in Austin. 

Your dismissal of the EOB is just lame. We only had to pay a small amount because we challenged the bill (with no help at all from your office). Someone without the knowledge or experience of dealing with insurance companies and health providers would have never been able to negotiate the fee as we did. Most folks would have been stuck with a $3,000 bill and turned over to a collection agency if they refused to pay it.

If it's so easy, why didn't your staff help us instead of saying it's our problem? All they did was call the lab and have them call us. If you think Chris is one of the nicest guys you will ever want to meet, that explains a lot.

Thank you for your time."
567,"I will say that scheduling and promptness of service was great. I was able to make an appointment for the same morning and go straight to the clinic. When I arrived I was greeted and was seen fairly shortly thereafter, just about right on time. Paid my money for the visit.

I went in because I was having pain on my right side and also trouble with breathing. I would be out of breath in just three steps. I had recently had a head and chest cold and thought it was just something left over. I had no other symptoms, fevers, chills, nausea etc.

After the PA checked me over, listened to my chest, temp etc she said that I would need to have my Gall Bladder removed and that was her diagnosis. I asked her how she came up with that as I did not think I had any of the symptoms and she replied that what she diagnosed it being and that was her opinion. 

So I decided to go to the ER at the local hospital. As soon as they listened to my chest they said they needed to get me a chest x-ray as my right lung did not sound good at all. Before I was even back in the ER room after the X-ray they had already told my wife that I needed to be admitted and also needed an emergency chest tube put in. With that they extracted over 700ml of fluid from around my lung and that my lung was partially collapsed. They were shocked to hear that another physician could have missed that just about an hour before.

I ended up having and plural epyema and ended up having two surgeries and a hospital stay of 10 days. 

Glad I decided to go to the ER after my visit to Zoomcare Vancouver."
568,"READ THIS BEFORE YOU GO! 
I usually don't write reviews but people must know this place isn't your typical hometown Dental office. ( I should have waited to go back home and see my Dr. Rutland)
So.....,
I walked In the waiting room was nice and quiet...this was my first visit here and was initially excited about what this visit would be like from the appearance of the waiting room. There was a comfortable sofa, a flat screen TV which was obviously on loop advertising teeth whitening products ...boy was I WRONG! I went back to my first chair where the dental assistant asked me what type of brush I use before even looking at my teeth. I use a hard bristled manual brush which apparently is going to eradicate all my gums according to the hygienist Then I saw the mechanical toothbrush set sitting behind her that she tried to sell me on. I told her I probably have 5 electric brushes at home in a drawer because my parents for some reason tend to give me one for Christmas every year.
   Next came the XRays that took over 20 minutes as the technology is very outdated. (This whole time I'm in a room staring at advertisement pictures on the wall, one of a picture of a lady who I was extremely distracted by her uneven painted on eyebrows and makeup, that I couldn't even tell you what the advertisement is for....They couldn't position the chair at least in front of the window?). Oh and worst of all her gloves smelled like ****.....I wanted to vomit the whole time as I wondered if it was just a rare type of latex or if.....well use your imagination. 
   The dentist came in and asked if I smoke, drink soda, drink tea, or drink coffee?...um yeah! Shame on me!....who doesn't do at least one of those! I told her I smoke maybe 2 cigarettes a day....big mistake on my part... This led to a game of 50 questions by the dentist (who spoke as if she was reading a script) consisting of ""on a scale of 1 to 10 how much do you want to quit?"" And then the same for what scale do I think I can quit?  There was another 1 to 10 scale question that I can't even remember what it was because I cut her off. She then asked if I've heard of the medication and patches used to quit, and then told me when I quit don't go cold turkey.....this is when I got really weirded out...I cut her off and said - ""I'm on Vyvanse  and only smoke when I take Vyvanse as needed. I'm not addicted and don't think about smoking when I don't take my meds"" I actually asked them ""I did come here to get my teeth cleaned, right"".   
   So the next part( an hour into the visit and still no start on the cleaning) they talked about my teeth being stained on the backside....I don't really care! I'm always getting complements on how white my teeth are! Then came the very minuscule gap in 2 of my teeth. It's barely noticeable! So at that point I was of course sold on Invisalign!! Then a retainer to keep my teeth from shifting. Then I was asked if I grit my teeth at all? Yeah sometimes. Oh Jesus! That led to me needing a teeth guard to wear to protect from the gritting. So there's 2 or 3 people quoting this now.... I never even said I wanted it! Then as the doctor and nurse are right behind me looking at my x Rays one comments "" look at how long those roots are"" and heard one slightly giggle....I shot up on my chair and asked ""what does that mean????""-in a tone I've rarely ever heard out of me but it did from frustration. They said it was a good thing but to this day I feel like my apparent tree trunk roots is a rare deformity I have but never knew it. 
   So at this point I was frustrated and hungry and straight up told them I don't want any extras! I just want my teeth cleaned....and finally I move to another room (this one had a window, but no privacy between you and the lady beside you having her plaque scraped out of her teeth). This is where she cleaned my teeth and sprayed plaque and water all over my face ( it was a very sloppy job, but can't complain about that part too much... I just wanted it over....until she finished and said I had 1 cavity... My heart stopped. I haven't had a cavity in 25 years and take really good care of my teeth. The cavity she was referring to was a small pocket in my bottom molar that has been there my whole life. I told her if she checks the other side of my mouth too you'll see that tooth has the same pocket there ( it's genetic on my family) but harmless! She. Then saw the other pocket and agreed that they weren't cavities! 
   And finally it was done..... But not before she tried to sell me on some cream to put on my teeth to help the stains from my horrible coffee drinking habits! So this is so long but you should know what you are getting yourself into! This is a chain company who I'm sure are the only dentists I've been to who act like they work on Commision."
569,"Dr DeVitre has provided me with great service over the years and 2 years ago healed me from a very bad abscess. Dr DeVitre is not inexpensive so I tried another dentist for a root canal. He messed it up and the tooth assessed right through to my sinus. Dr DeVitre removed the tooth and patched the hole with a bone graft and some very fancy stitches. Later he installed an implant and I am in great shape now. If he wasn't so skilled and creative I think I might have had a very bad time with the infection. 
I highly recommend him and his great staff"
570,"I have an almost 3 year old and a 3 month old. We have been to the office for both children. Dr.Littleton is great and we went to her because she was my husbands pediatrician. I have to say that from the start I have hated going to this office and it stresses me out to no end. Every time we have an appointment we wait minimum 30 mins. Last time I was there with my 1 month old baby and waited 45 mins for our appointment, I was on time but they were not. Long story short the office is always unbearably hot and the lighting is so bright it gives me a headache to wait in the waiting room. I was left in the waiting room until baby became fussy from not eating for over an hour counting time to drive to the office. I asked to at least be put in a room because A. there were sick kids there and I wasn't trying to let my newborn catch something B. She was hungry and I needed to nurse her C. Because I was tired of walking back and forth with her trying to calm her down with no clue on when we would be seen, it took another 10 mins for them to let me in a room to feed her. I had the same problem with my first child and I really hate taking them to appointments. I understand that sometimes doctors run behind but this happens every time. A couple appointments ago I was 5 minutes late and they wanted me to reschedule! I was so angry that I would be asked to reschedule when they can make me wait 45- and hour past my appointment time every time we go in."
571,"Agree with all comments. I was promptly at the office at the scheduled 8 AM and my forms filled out by 8:10. The person I was scheduled to see however didn't even get into the building until 8:40 AM and nobody took the time to inform me of this until I asked somebody-I believe she was probably an MA who I asked when I saw the 3rd person who'd come in after me get asked to come back, so I asked her what was up and when she came back to get the next patient (not until then), she said ""oh the person you're seeing isn't here yet"" - just very matter of fact, no apology, and she kind of rolled her eyes when I expressed frustration that I'd even had to ask, that nobody had thought to inform me proactively. None of the front desk staff informed me. And nobody apologized except for the person I was actually scheduled to see who said she had just come in late that day because she'd been stuck in traffic or whatever. 
The experience from scheduling the appointment, and checking in with the front desk, were both subpar experiences - the front desk staff was unfriendly. The scheduler was unfriendly. 

Finally - There is a lot of redundancy in the forms you have patients fill out, and on top of it a lot of that information I had given over the phone to begin with. The front desk staff also were discussing another patient's insurance issues loudly, then summoned her up to further discuss it in a manner I found very inappropriate - not private at all. If that had been me I'd have been pretty pissed."

573,"Best ENT I've ever been to bar none!!!!  I've had sinus issues for many years that led to uncontrolled asthma.  These sinus problems kept me sick for several months of the year.  Dr. Slaughter was the only one who found the root cause of my problem.  His sinus surgery changed my life.  I had always heard about how awful sinus surgery was so I certainly was dreading the whole thing.  Let me tell you, it wasn't that bad at all and I believe this is due to him knowing how to do the surgery without sending you home with packing in your nose.  That would have been miserable.  My recovery was quick and complete.  Dr. Slaughter's staff is excellent as well. His nurse, Erica, is smart and professional providing excellent care to his patients."
574,"Horrible service all three times I've gone. The lens crafters store in the mall is horrible unfriendly and highly unprofessional service. Think twice before letting yourself go to this lens crafters. The guys at Macy's on the other hand. PHENOMENAL. Don't go to the store unless you wanna be disrespected with poor customer service. I tried going and the lady got mad so I resorted to the one in Macy's where I was treated very kindly. The guys at Macy's are a 10/10. The lady's at the store were all very unfriendly. Had to get the lenses fixed and needed them fixed soon so had to go to the actual store so that I could get them fixed quicker. I called probably 4 times trying to see the hours of the optician and the entire time they told me not to worry. Called before I headed over there as well then when I got there he was on break for the next hour. Eventually got them dropped off. Wish they had same day fixed at the LensCrafters inside Macy's. Afterwards when I went to go pick up the glasses the lady at the store kept having to make snarky comments as she fixed my glasses to fit my face. Might I add the guys at Macy's were kind enough to wipe their finger prints off my glasses after they fit them on my face. The lady at the store was even frustrated to fix my glasses that were crooked and my glasses were covered in finger prints. Moral of the story, go to Macy's for great service with glasses or if you want poor service you can resort for the store. PS, Richard from Macy's even called me days later to see how I was adjusting to my glasses!!! GO TO MACYS LENSCRAFTERS."
575,"A bad car accident caused several severe degenerative bone issues. I wasn't interested in traditional bone eroding cortisone injections...they hadn't worked for other family members. The first adjustment I had was alright.  He took his time and explained things to me. He verbally walked me through it.  He explained some of the specific issues were present in my x-rays/MRI's. I was told I had evidence of bone degeneration in hips, lower spine and advanced arthritis in my knee. Afterwards, I could stand up and walk much better.... for awhile. 
But after the second (very abrupt) adjustment to the left and right of my neck I saw stars and felt a jolt of pain go up my spine. Previously I'd had rotator cuff surgery and it took  a year and half of PT to get my left arm/shoulder back to full rotation of my shoulder. After the 4/9/18 adjustment I was in agony. I already couldn't sleep on my right side. Now, I was unable to sleep on the left side, the ONLY side I had been able to sleep on. It became necessary to ice my entire left shoulder and arm in order to get even a couple of hours of sleep. After the ice packs melted, I was in trouble. Also, I was no longer able to swim. Tingling and numbness in my hand, wrist, and shooting pain was nearly a constant, not to mention some weird constant chronic itching. I was assured that it would ""go away in awhile."" It took over a month and a half, another appointment with a different chiropractor. I went to the Wellness Center for help because I wanted my life back, instead, I now have additional problems with a re-injury to my shoulder.  It set me back years. I can't believe that a medical professional would  wittingly or un-wittingly do me such harm.
I was also surprised that there was no ramp into their office and a rug that many people who had a hard enough time getting up the large stairs, sometimes tripped over.  One day when I came, a young woman had her husband carry her wheelchair up the stairs for her while she struggled up the stairs. I also witnessed three different clients sobbing
in the front lobby area, shaking their heads and speaking loudly over their cell phones about their negative experiences that day. I pay attention to that kind of thing...if I'm not feeling like I'm being taken well care of...I look to see how others are reacting. The front desk staff is brusque and has bad attitude to spare. Its all about the money, it seems, and getting you in as often as possible and on some sort of schedule without an explanation of why it is important. I got a whole lot of negative attitude after I decided to wait a bit on the $18,300 stem cell treatment which may or may not have brought me back to good old 50 percent...but wait, the fine print said, sorry there's no guarantee. That isn't  going to work for me, ever."
576,"I am seriously terrified of dentists, at least I used to be.  Since going to Dr. Goldwyn I no longer am afraid to go to the dentist.  I had an infected nerve in my tooth that acted up while I was visiting a friend in Portland.  The staff was friendly and worked very hard to find a spot for me.  The doctor was not only good, but explained everything that he was doing, so as not to feed my fear.  I would recommend them to anyone."
577,"This WAS a great dental office. Dr. Skromme, Linda, Holly...they were professional, honest, friendly, kind, and treated me like family--everything this new practice is not. Be warned. It's now called 5282, and the new (very young) dentist/owner is clearly ""trying"" to market herself to Boulder County hipsters. She ""let go"" all of Dr. Skromme's wonderful hygienists. I had been seeing Linda since 2000, when I was in my early- 20s! She was like a second mom to me...I was devastated! When I went in for my last cleaning, I knew something was wrong--no Linda (my appt was supposed to be with her, but she wasn't there, and no one called to tell me) and no Holly at the front desk (she would've given me a heads up that Linda was out). I also had to wait for the first time ever--and not just 5 or 10 minutes, more like 30!! I was used to walking in, Linda would be waiting, and she'd greet me with a big hug. I was on my lunch break (which is when I always scheduled cleanings since their office was close to my office in Niwot). I was always in and out in less than an hour, and that included ample time to chit-chat with Linda.. They told me they only had time to do a cleaning that day (ummm, not my fault!!) and I'd have to come back the following week for an exam and xrays (even though I had those done 6 months before) with the new dentist. I explained that didn't work for me, as I had already used a lunch break, plus 40 minutes additional PTO time (because they were running late) and couldn't squeeze that into my schedule next week. That did not go over well, and I got reprimanded for not being compliant with their treatment plan. They also insisted I schedule three cleanings a year (only 2 covered by insurance) and told me I was at risk for serious dental issues in the future. Odd. First time anyone has told me that. Other than a chipped front tooth and fixing an old filling, I haven't had a cavity or needed dental work in over 30 years!! They also insisted I needed to be using a SoniCare toothbrush. When I explained that I had one, but I didn't like how much it vibrates and how loud it is, the hygienist and dentist laughed at me. Thanks for being sensitive to sensory/auditory processing disorders...Long story short, I'm not going back. They were rude and I felt like I couldn't trust them. I hate being ""upsold"" at the dentist office. I guess if you're ok with a faux hipster vibe, rudeness, and being sold on the latest and greatest un-needed dental services, go here. Sad. All the awesome old-school dentists and hygienists are disappearing."
578,"So as the last remaining person I think to actually have given this place a good rating, it's time to make an important update. This place is the absolute worst. To be completely fair I think the work Dr. Joseph Hart performs is quality. But for so many reasons explained by many others regarding lack of office professionalism, price gauging and unnecessary procedures recommended, I have to remove my previous rating.  Everyone warned me about this ""As seen on TV"" dentist but I was a faithful patient until now.  Why the change of heart?

Today I went in for a rescheduled appointment. The original appt had to be rescheduled because I arrived 15 minutes late and the doctor had gone out for a walk... And never returned! I waited for an hour before they told me he wasn't coming back. During this hour wait I witnessed the two other staff having an extremely  unprofessional yelling match. I had taken a half day off work to be a part of this debacle but they promised me a later appt the following week to accommodate. 

So I'm waiting today in the Cambridge office having called an hour before I left my office in Waltham to confirm  my appt and guarantee the doc hadn't gone on any long walks, and two things happened;  with no notice, they told me I needed to pay $3500.00 for the gum graft and the crown before they could start the procedure even though the crown wouldn't be put on until my next appt. I call my husband to get my FSA info and that I'll put the rest on my Amex. Fine she says. Then tells me they don't take Amex so I'll have to reschedule unless I can pay in full. I asked why she didn't think it was important to tell me this before my appointment and she said ""I just thought you would know"". Then, she proceeds to tell me that she doesn't even see my name in the schedule for today. WTF? I called only an hour before where they told me.. Yup, all set for today, Stacie. 

I will never return despite being halfway through the implant procedure and having paid 3k of the 6.5k procedure. Waste of my time and my money.  Cutting my losses."

580,"Great hospital. Been to the ER 3x in the last 8 months to accompany my spouse. The last time the wait was exceptionally long. Regardless, what ER doesn't have a long wait? 
The doctor is always quick and to the point. Will be back soon!"
581,"-I have a great dermatologist at The Vancouver Clinic at Columbia Tech Center! When I was diagnosed with cancer he truly was my best advocate. But his presence is the only reason why I continue to go there. I was unavoidably 12 minutes late to an appointment, and did not expect to be seen, and I was expected to pay. (I think it was $188.) Ok, that's fair. But the condescending letter which I received from The Vancouver Clinic a few weeks later was offensive and insulting. See another review from someone else for a more detailed description of what is in this form letter that is sent out to everyone who is late, whether it is unavoidable or not.

-I chose a primary doctor there, and have been disappointed. Both doctors----the excellent dermatologist and the mediocre doc who is simply trying to keep his head above water---are always rushed for time. I believe the Vancouver Clinic erodes quality of service by pushing these professionals to see so many clients in such a short time frame. It is unrealistic to expect that they can do a thoughtful history and physical for each client. The stressed, the very young, and the very old simply need more time with their doctor than The Vancouver Clinic allocates.

-Screwed up billing. Hold off paying your bills as long as you can, because they really flail around with insurance (well, who doesn't, it's a broken system), but will charge you more before the insurance company has settled its share. I have learned to check with my insurance company before paying any bill from The Vancouver Clinic.

If my excellent dermatologist leaves The Vancouver Clinic I have another doctor lined up, and you can bet that this potential new doc has no connection to The Vancouver Clinic. It's totally worth the drive for a more sane, less demeaning experience in a different clinic.

In response to the totally off-base response from The Vancouver Clinic, I sent this msg.:

""Please take the time to reread my review on Yelp. If you do so, you will see that I have no complaint about payment for a missed appointment. I am, like other clients who have experienced what I did, deeply offended by the condescending reprimand letter I received from The Vancouver Clinic, and as a health professional I am concerned about the overbooking practices that do not allow the practitioners the time they need to spend with clients, especially the stressed, the very young, and the very old."""
582,"Run, don't walk, far away from this place!

I had a rhinoplasty done here in 2011. My nose healed not only crooked but unsymmetrical within a year of surgery. When I called the office, I was told there was a $150 to see him. Why I have to pay an addition $150 when I already shelled out $7,000 is not only absurd but bad business...I was a returning patient extremely unhappy with the results. I was appalled and offended that Dr. Gross would want uneven work to be walking around Orlando, knowing I would not recommend him to anyone who asked, and could clear display his botched work. Don't worry, I stupidly went back, paid the consult fee, and was quoted $12,00 for a revision of his OWN WORK!!! This should have been complimentary, at least make my nose straight!! I guess an uneven nose is ""fine"" for him and wants to charge patients for his own mistakes. 

I truly hope if you are reading this, you will consider going somewhere else!!!"
583,"Where do I start? First off, in the rooms they have a sign asking for your Yelp review, so here mine is! Let's start at the front desk. I went in for a cough but there is a serious stomach bug going around so I asked the women if any one waiting, only a few people, were there for the bug. Of course she explained that she couldn't tell me that info. However she neglected to let me know that on the other side of the check in desk there were masks I could wear if I was concerned!!! Hello! I only saw them when I was leaving! Thanks. Meanwhile on the electronic sign that shows what place in line you are there is some computer pop up covering half the list so I had to ask her to exit out of the pop up so we could see the dang thing. 

I didn't have to wait too long as a walk in. I saw three people leave and soon after three went back. So I was hopefully everything would move quickly. 

The nurse (I guess she's a nurse) that took me back and asked for my symptoms to tell the doctor was so incredibly unfriendly. I waited what seemed like forever for the doctor! I had to pull the leg rest out of the bed seat in the room because my back started hurting from sitting so long. 

The doctor finally comes in and I basically tell her I have bronchitis so she listens to my cough and lungs and says she agrees and asks me what I've taken to help bronchitis in the past. So basically she got paid for me to do all the work. 

At this point it's 7pm on Saturday night and most the pharmacy's are closed. As they are trying to kick me out I'm trying to google one that is open. I'm shocked that they don't have a record or a clue of pharmacies in the area that are open late. 

Long story short I basically did everyone's job for them from the front desk sign to my diagnosis to finding a pharmacy. 

*i will say this wasn't my frost visit and my pervious visit with the male Asian doctor was much much better."
584,"One star and that's a gift for past experiences. Just walked out of this factory with my sick child after being told they won't see him unless I leave a credit card on file for billing. First of all- we have top of the line insurance, no deductible, a copay which I pay each time, our play pays quickly and at a high rate. Apparently, as I was told by the x ray tech at the desk that the medical reimbursement is low. So am I to assume they bill the differences with the ""card on file"" . They refused to see a sick child unless I left a credit card on file, even after speaking with practice administrator and physician."
585,"I went to Softtouch Dentistry for longer than I should have, and I no longer trust Dr. Bidabadi. I am concerned for other patients of hers, and I hope that my review can shed some light on this dental practice. I used to trust their talk about thorough care, but I have come to feel like just a source of revenue for them.

The problems have been in billing, extra procedures, not listening to my concerns and pushy up-selling. Many smaller things add up to a negative experience and a lack of trust, overall.

Extra procedures/costs:
-They said that my gums were bad and that I needed deep cleaning, followed by periodontal maintenance(4 cleanings/year), but other dentists and a periodontist said that this was not the case.
-Dr. Bidabadi said that I needed a filling, and I was getting suspicious, so I checked with another dentist, who said there was not even a cavity in that tooth.
-This office only uses white fillings, even on molars. I know that there are arguments for and against white vs. silver fillings, but a friend of mine who used to work in a different dental office told me that dentists get more money for using only white fillings, even though they do not last as long as silver ones.

Up-selling
-While I was waiting for an implant, Dr. Bidabadi told me that I needed ""a flipper"" or a fake tooth implanted into a plastic retainer in place of the missing tooth. My periodontist said that flippers are just cosmetic, and that my implant timeline was short enough that there was no need to fill the gap in the meantime.
-She repeatedly said, over several years, ""promise me that you will whiten your teeth"", ""you must whiten your teeth"", and many other attempts to get me to whiten my teeth. Her language was sometimes ambiguous enough that it seemed like she wanted to imply that this cosmetic procedure was actually necessary.

Not listening:
-Years ago, she sent me to an oral surgeon to have a tooth extracted. This surgeon, during removal of an incisor, was visibly flustered and loudly cursing, and removed some of the bone around the tooth in order to remove it after he broke the tooth. I needed a bone graft after this to replace the bone loss. More recently, when it was time for another extraction, I told her I was uncomfortable going back to him, and said that I wanted to try a different surgeon this time. She let out a fake laugh, said, ""Oh he is funny, he just jokes"". I told her he was serious, and she told me, ""now, you just go and see him."" I am still feeling the effects of that bone loss, and after she said this to me, I decided that I was finally through with her. I saw an independent periodontist to do my extraction and implant, and other dentists for second and third opinions.

Billing:
-They said they wanted me in for a deep cleaning, but did not tell me how much it would cost out of pocket after insurance until after the procedure. They also did not tell me that they would only do half my mouth at a time until after they were done with the procedure, and then they told me that I would need to come in to get the other half done later, saying nothing about cost. 
-They refuse to use silver fillings, and did not tell me that my insurance would not cover the white fillings until after they already put them in.
-When I left the practice, after calling them multiple times and sending them a signed letter asking for my records to be sent to my new dentist, they waited a week and mailed me a bill for $25 to release the x-rays. 

For the most part, they have been cordial, except when I called to ask about the charges for sending my x-rays (which the patient legally owns) to my new dentist. Their office manager said she hoped that she would never hear from me again.

I went to this office for about 5 years, and I feel like a fool for trusting them as long as I did.  I want to warn all other trusting people about this office."
586,"I would like to begin by saying the pictures posted on the website are taken immediately after the filler treatment. 
I had the naso-labial fillers and it did not work. It, actually, made the situation worse. 
There was no numbing crème or pre-filler treatment. It was painful.
Upon completion of the session, my face looked great. However, once the swelling decreased, the folds were worse. It has caused the lines at the corners of the  mouth to become more pronounced, also.
This is just to say, wait until the swelling is gone before determining the success/failure of the treatment. 
I don't know about you, but for me,  twelve hundred ($1200.00) dollars is not a small amount for a service not obtained.
Beware!"
587,"I don't like writing negative reviews but in this case I find it absolutely necessary.
When finding out I was pregnant with our second, I was obviously super excited and eager to see a doctor and start my prenatal care. I stepped into this office which felt more like a Planned Parenthood. The waiting area was old and outdated, and the medical rooms had such a sad feel to them as well. The receptionist was ignorant as far as insurance goes and caused me a lot of anxiety. I panicked and the supervisor front office lady tried to comfort me. I give her kudos for trying even though she was super condescending. It seemed like she was aware her front staff was a bit lost.
When I went to the back it seemed unprofessional too. I drove home crying because this office seriously made me feel like my pregnancy was a chore, not worthy of celebrating. It was such a dull, negative tone the whole time...in a very dreary office. 
So yeah that wasn't good. I cancelled my next appointments (the ultrasound and OB visit to review the ultrasound were a week apart!!! That's crazy!!!) I have been seeing a new OB who actually seems to care about their patients, especially their pregnant ones. Anyway Heart of OB has been sending me a BILL for an appointment I cancelled in advance for $1500!!!!! It's been months and they keep sending it with a date of the appointment I cancelled. I paid my copay for the one and only appointment I went to. Funny enough this $1500 bill they are sending me is NOT going through my insurance. My insurance did not receive this claim. Probably because THERES NO CLAIM! There's nothing additional I owe this office but they keep sending a faulty, ILLEGAL BILLING STATEMENT in hopes I'll just blindly send them $1500, under the table if you will. I am outraged. I visited here once, vowed never again, and now almost 4 months later I'm still dealing with stress caused by them. 
Literally the worst medical experience I've ever had and it's just unbelievable the illegal extents they are taking."
588,"Dr. Nevins saved my teeth. After over five (yes, five) years trying unsuccessfully to get an implant at another place, I was ready to throw in the towel and resign myself to never chewing on my left side again. I had lost a molar in the back of my upper jaw, and my sinus was so low that the roots of the tooth penetrated into the sinus cavity. That may be OK for natural teeth, but implants need to be anchored into bone, so a sinus lift (aka a bone graft) was required. The loss of the tooth and the subsequent hole in the sinus caused sinus infections which spread to the neighboring tooth and that one had to be taken out as well. Numerous attempts at placing a bone graft were unsuccessful, and once enough bone was built up, it wasn't strong enough to hold the implant that the other surgeon had placed, so that it eventually failed. As a last resort, I went to Dr. Nevins for a consultation. In his calm, friendly manner, he said that my situation was difficult but not hopeless. He had me go for a CAT scan and then created a computerized 3D model of the area, which allowed him to plan the best placement for the implants. The first surgery, another bone graft, was very long, something over an hour. I was impressed how Dr. Nevins never lost his concentration during the long and difficult procedure, his movements always assured. I felt that I was in the hands of a very skilled surgeon. Even the stitches felt particularly neatly and evenly placed. The area healed well and the graft took like a charm. Even Dr. Nevins's father (also a dental surgeon), who was present during one of the follow up visits, was impressed! The second surgery was for placing the implants, which was comparatively a piece of cake. Dr. Nevins had a guide made based off the computer model, to show him where to drill the holes for the implants. He also grafted some gum over the area to make sure that it would hold the new teeth. Overall, I believe that Dr. Nevins's careful, methodical approach, combined with his skill as a surgeon is what made the surgery a success. Now, my teeth are restored and I can enjoy all the steak I want. I recommend Dr. Nevins to anyone in the unfortunate predicament of needing dental surgery. He has also performed a crown lengthening procedure on two teeth and that was much less of an ordeal but also very well done.

I can't forget to mention all the wonderful staff in the office. The office itself is very clean and modern, and there are always fresh flowers at reception. Everyone who works there is very friendly and competent. It is clear that the doctor takes great pride in his practice.

I hope not to see Dr. Nevins anytime soon, but should I be needing more implants in the future, I will never go to anyone else. Thank you, Dr. Nevins!"
589,"I really can't decide how I feel about Zoom Care. I have been there a handful of times, with some bad and some good experiences. 

I give them four stars because IT IS WHAT IT IS. Like other reviewers have mentioned, it's like bare minimum health care. Go here if you have a sore throat, do not go here if you have a more complex and serious illness. 

My worst experience was when I came to the Pearl location with a terrible sore throat. I saw a rather young doctor, who said something to the effect of ""well yeah, when you have a sore throat, it tends to hurt a bit."" It was pretty condescending, especially when two days later they informed me I had strep throat. 

There are many positives about Zoom. It is modern and clean, makes it feel more like you're waiting to get some fancy plastic surgery done or something! HA. They are open pretty late most nights and make appointments every 15 minutes. You can call or schedule online. Another nice aspect is that they call and email you with your results and check in on you after a visit."
590,"Avoid this hospital if possible.  My mother spent 8 days here.  She still has emotional trauma from it.  The nurses on the 8th floor were so uncaring and unavailable.  She was not taken for a walk for 8 days or had a shower in 8 days. She was Never out of bed for all this time and (she was able to with nurse assistance) Every time she asked they told her they didn't have time for that. They never assisted her with her food.  She didn't eat until the last two days.  She was given lots of lasix so that made for full bladder more than usual.   If she buzzed for nurse they would charge in room and say ""now what"".  If she tried to go herself they would yell at her.  Then there was a dr that called to say my mother had no more than two hours to live.  Of course we were shocked and gathered my sisters ...  we are together about an hour after this call beyond upset that out of the blue she was dying...and then the phone rings.... it was our mother calling to say goodnight!!  To say we were angry is an understatement.  This ""dr"" said oh I gave her a little more lasix and she is fine now.  The dr in charge apologized and said she was absolutely not near end of life. These drs and nurses are so unprofessional and unqualified.  My mother is home and her primary believes she has emotional trauma from the way she was treated.  This ""dr"" did apologize to her primary dr and apologized to us through him.  I can't imagine anyone wanting their loved one cared for by these people."
591,"I'd give at least 4 starts here for the location--it's in a cool old house off of MLK, but that's not what's really important in a doctor's office, right?  What's important is the quality of care.  I am still recovering from years as a Kaiser patient, so I am now always astonished by the level of service I receive in a private clinic, and I was (mostly) not disappointed here.  I had a very short wait, and  the staff in the clinic were very friendly and helpful.  They outlined a treatment plan that was more elaborate than I had hoped for, but they explained their reasons clearly.  I had two follow up appointments--both brief and effortless--and all was well.  
EXCEPT...Part of what I wanted was lazer treatment for a dark spot on my face.  My appointment for this was the dark spot for Knott Street Dermatology.  The esthetician kept me waiting for a half hour while she chatted with the previous patient.  Chatted, not treated--I could both see and hear them.  And she knew I was there. Then she lied about it.  So I wasn't very happy about that, and it made me mad enough that I wouldn't see her again.
But otherwise it was a good experience, and I would go back."
592,"there's probably a good chance i would have died...if i waited in their waiting room much longer than i did (~6 hours).
i went here back when i was in undergrad (ohio state university), in 2004 or 2005.  i told them i felt pain (9 out of 10) near the bottom of my abdomen, i felt constipated, etc.  
there were a lot of people in the emergency room.  most people appeared to be in much less discomfort / pain than me.  after waiting ~5 hours at the ohio state university medical center emergency room [OSUMCER] (complaining at least 2-3 times that i needed to see a doctor ASAP and being told that other people have been waiting longer than me by the staff at the OSUMCER and laying on my back in the waiting room in agony) i called my x-girlfriend and had her pick me up and take me to riverside methodist hospital emergency room [RMHER].  
while my x-girlfriend was pulling up to the front entrance to the RMHER she had to pull over so that i could vomit.  once i made it into the emergency room waiting area i saw that there were only 1 or 2 sets of people (much less than at OSUMCER).  i was checked out and moved into a hospital room within 30 minutes.  i was sent in for a cat scan within 30 minutes and (at the request of some friends that were visiting me) put on a pain killer because i could not keep still from the pain.  within 30 minutes of the cat scan i was being escorted to the surgery room to have my appendix removed.  
when i woke up the pain was gone (except for soreness from surgery).  apparently (according to the doctor) your appendix is supposed to be about the size of your pinky finger (~ 2 inches long for me) and when they removed my appendix it was 6 inches long...so i'm very lucky that it didn't burst (it releases toxins into your body that can kill you).  i remained at RMHER for 1 day and was able to make requests for a pain killer to be released into my iv.  everyone was very nice.  
my mother visited me from 2 hours away (she is a nurse).  when i told her what happened she was very upset with OSUMCER staff because had my appendix burst i could have been fighting for my life.  she called and complained to the head nurse.  he briefly reviewed my information and confirmed that i had pain 9 out of 10.  he said that he would do a full review; however, we were disappointed that he never got back to us and/or apologized.  
i highly recommend that anyone considering between ohio state university medical center emergency room and riverside methodist hospital emeregency room to choose riverside methodist hospital emeregency room...and again, this is coming from an ohio state university alumni (whom has donated every year)."

594,"Absolutely the worst dental experience I have ever had. I made a new patient appointment for the advertised $59 cleaning, x-rays, and exam. Dr. Ayoub reviewed my x-rays and pointed out areas of concern. She commented on my sinuses and told me I would be a good candidate for an ear, nose, & throat doctor - she told me she had never seen sinuses that low before. She then informed me I had 7 cavities. This was shocking to me considering my last cleaning at another dentist was in July 2018. I was surprised to learn I had developed 7 cavities, especially because I have only ever had 2 cavities in my lifetime. Then the office manager comes in to go over the cost of the dental work prior to performing any work on my teeth. This was much appreciated because it all goes south from here. The office manager brought up an invoice for $2,200 but told me if I signed up for their discount plan, I could knock it down to $1,700. I asked if I could just stick with the $59 new patient cleaning for today. The office manager told me she would have to see if the dental hygienist has any availability in his schedule. I asked, ""Isn't that what my appointment is for?"" She then said, ""Oh, you made an appointment?"" At this point I am very confused... How else would I be back here? She sent the x-ray tech to talk to the doctor and the x-ray tech came back to explain to me that they would need to do a deep cleaning ($150) around one area of my mouth. I told them I would prefer to wait and think about the other services and would like to just get the basic cleaning. She told me that wasn't an option. They then pointed at a chart regarding periodontal disease and showed me where I am headed if I don't get all the work they recommend taken care of. Scare tactics aren't too effective with me. Dr. Ayoub made it clear that we should skip the basic cleaning for that day and instead get the fillings taken care of. I was told I could re-schedule the cleaning when the hygienist is available. Again, I remind you... the whole reason I came in was for a routine cleaning. When I learned that wasn't an option, I asked if I could leave. It was extremely awkward. The office manager then said, ""Would you like to go ahead and schedule your 6 month follow-up?"" And I replied, ""A follow up? For what?"" YOU DIDN'T EVEN CLEAN MY TEETH! I waited a week to write this review because I had scheduled an appointment at a different dentist for today. I am happy to report to all who are reading this that I have NO CAVITIES! I was also told at the new dentist that they see sinuses like mine all the time and it's no cause for concern. The best part about this is I had sent my Oviedo Smiles x-rays to the new dentist, so he was looking at the very same x-rays Dr. Ayoub went over with me. All this to say... It seems Oviedo Smiles' goal is to get new patients in the door and then to bombard them with extensive, unneeded dental work. I hate to think about how they planned to put 7 fillings into my teeth that show no decay or need for fillings. This place is a scam. They are unprofessional, unethical, and don't seem to care at all about the patient sitting in front of them. I am grateful I didn't fall into their trap and I hope this review prevents others from having to go through a similar experience."
595,"I have been going to this dentist for years, I hadn't had any dental work for a long time and was very nervous. They have always been super nice to me, and always on top of things. Once there was a time when something got messed up or overlooked, and that's to be expected, people are human. But they fixed the problem quickly and kept me informed, so it was a total non-issue.  They are so helpful when I call on the phone trying to calculate how much things might cost or asking questions about procedures. All their dentists are really good, but I had to have Dr. Bird do my wisdom teeth. I was really super nervous and obviously didn't enjoy the procedure at all. He was so nice and caring during the whole thing and the follow up, it was like he actually was worried about me. They have also always been very nice to my boyfriend

I don't think the nice little touches are gimmicky at all, they're not going super out of their way to do these things, and the dentist office would still be nice without it. They have some little aromatherapy oils, lots of different types of lip moisturizer, various ipod shuffles with different music, and a paraffin hand dip thing. 

I still go to green apple and I'm going to continue to go there, I would recommend them to anybody!"
596,"This office was completely unhelpful and wouldn't see me. 

I called my insurance company to ask which dentist I could see since I have a DHMO plan and had previously had issues with providers accepting it. My insurance company sent me to Brident Dental on North Lamar and said I could see any dentist who accepted my plan, but that Gelade Maurice was at that location and could see me. So I called to set up the appointment with Brident. I gave the appointment maker all of my insurance information, explained the issues I've had in the past with dentists accepting my DHMO plan, and had him confirm that my plan was accepted specifically at the North Lamar location by Gelade Maurice, so I set the appointment. 
When I arrived for my appointment today, the receptionist said that my insurance wasn't accepted, and that Gelade Maurice did not work at their location. I immediately called my insurance agent who confirmed again that my insurance was accepted at this location. He requested to speak to the receptionist so I gave her my cell phone. She told him that Gelade Maurice didn't work at this location. My insurance agent asked for the name of the dentist that did work there and after giving it to him he said that I could see that dentist. But apparently the dentist wasn't the problem. The receptionist said that although Brident does accept my insurance company, the rates for the DHMO plan aren't entered into their system and there's no way to manually enter them, so they wouldn't know how much to charge me for services rendered. Now how does this make any sense?? They don't know how much to charge me?? My insurance agent argued with the receptionist about this for a bit and this receptionist was completely unwilling to help. She wouldn't give him or me straight-forward answers and repeated herself to avoid actually answering the questions asked. When he asked to speak to the provider - the dentist- she said that she was unwilling to allow him to speak to the provider and he wouldn't be able to answer any questions anyways because he didn't know anything about their rates. The dentist doesn't know how much he charges his patients for the services he provides to his patients?!? And she wouldn't let my insurance agent to speak to the provider, not because he was busy or with another patient, she just flat out refused to allow it! And he couldn't speak to the store manager because the manager wasn't there. 
I got my phone back and was advised by my insurance agent that I should seek dental services with another company which i opted to do solely based on the treatment and lack of customer care I received from the receptionists at Brident's North Lamar location. My insurance agent said he didn't understand why I was being refused because his system said that my insurance was accepted there, and what she was saying about them not knowing how to charge me made no sense to him. 

After getting off the phone with the insurance agent I returned to the front desk to get the store manager's contact information. I was furious at this point. I wanted to know why I was even able to make this appointment today if my insurance wasn't accepted and the dentist I was making the appointment with didn't work at that location. The receptionist said that Brident had a call center who made all of their appointments and she wasn't sure why they confirmed that my insurance was accepted. As far as making the appointment for me to see Gelade Maurice, she said that in order to make things easier for the corporate office, they listed all of the dentists who work for Brident at every one of their locations, regardless of whether they actually work at that location. So the people in the call center see every dentist is assigned to every location and have no idea where any of the dentists actually work but made me an appointment with a specific dentist at a specific location anyways. 

I've had a hole in my tooth for a long time and had put off seeing a dentist until after I'd had my baby. I'm in constant pain and am now taking so many otc pain meds that it's messing up my stomach. I took off work today and hired a babysitter to be at this appointment. I'd been looking forward to this appointment all week so I could finally get something done about this tooth pain.  I could have made an appointment with a dentist who would actually see me today but instead I got dicked around by Brident and now have to make another appointment and wait another week in pain every day to be seen so I can wait another week to actually get the work i need done. 

And the attitude the receptionists had about this whole ordeal was not one of sympathy or compassion, but more like 'sucks to be you'. 

I'm so furious."
597,"The providers omit information that could cause starting a new medication to be dangerous.  The providers claim they are available by email but are not.  Providers will charge you for a no show if their telehealth technology fails, even if the reason they don't have time to see you is that they scheduled 15min for a new patient (I was transferring because my original doctor left, and am appalled the appointment was so short).  The receptionist Erica may be rude to you and yell at you.  I have been in the process of moving today and my biggest source of stress is this awful practice.  If you don't want to develop trust issues with providers, don't see the doctors here."
598,"Absolutely horrible professional service. They do not know how to follow through and communicate with customers. If you call the office in order to obtain a refill on a prescription, then be prepared to have to call numerous times in order to finally get the refill completed. If you leave messages/voice-mails for the nurses, then be prepared for them not to return your calls. 

I called on a Wednesday to get a refill for a prescription. After explaining to an employee what I needed done, she transferred me to a nurse's voice-mail so I left a message regarding the prescription I needed refilled and to give me a call once it had been completed. I called the next day since I had not heard from anyone at the office regarding my request. I was then told to call back on Monday to make my request again despite already leaving a detailed message with what I needed done and also communicating to someone currently in the office what I needed done. Consequently, I called again the following week to check on the status of my request since I called nearly a week ago about the refills. However, I was dismayed when told that now (conveniently) my doctor who always sees me is out on vacation and the nurse cannot issue the refill without the doctor signing off on it. I have my issues with this particular procedure since nurses have routinely had the power to issue me new refills, however, my primary issue is that after a week of calling the employees, they did not have the professionalism or decency to let me know that my refill had not been issued yet due to the doctor leaving for vacation the week I called! Communication is a significant detriment for the employees at this office, and based on other comments and my past experiences, it has negatively impacted business.

Not being able to provide a customer with something is understandable to a degree, BUT not communicating on a CONSISTENT basis is a problem and one that I anticipate will begin to take its toll on the business soon if employees are not better instructed or trained on professionalism.

P.S. I did not want to give them one star, but had to in order to write the review. Poor service should not be tolerated!"
599,"Read All of these reviews first! Stay away from this place! They really must be hard up for cash! I started going here after a car accident so the other persons car insurance was paying. It was all good they collected $3,600. 
I was ready to discharge. Dr Lesko said no you are not ready you need more work! I told them my insurance is not great and i can not afford to pay out of pocket. The wife (Mrs. Lesko) then called my health insurance to see if i had any coverage. It turns out i was covered up to $2,500 if it was due to an accident. I called to make sure as well. They said yes so we proceeded with treatments. I cut down a lot on my treatments because they are way over priced and i could go elsewhere for my chiropractor for a quarter of the price. I was just seeing Lindsey who was great for Physical Therapy.  I even planned on going after discharge to see Lindsey once a week for a cash price that the wife and I had agreed on. I am now down to my last two visits and I got a call from Mrs. Lesko demanding that I need to pay in full by This Thursday or they are going to start charging late fees! 
She is upset with my Insurance company so they are taking it out on me?? She told me that the insurance company told her 20 more days and apparently they cant wait!?? So now i have to come up with $2,300 in 3 days or they start charging late fees. Hmmmm something is not right here? Not ok! Not professional at all! You don't give someone 3 days to pay that amount of money or you start charging extra!
I asked Dr Lesko what fax number they are sending the claims to and he wouldn't tell me!?  
I told him I planned on coming after and he acted like i was crazy to think i could come there for $35 for a 30 min visit which is what we agreed on with his wife, These people do not care about anyone! They only care about money!! Clearly from all these bad reviews! They wont even give the insurance company a chance to pay. It's only been a month and a half. Horrible Customer Service and so rude! We all know it takes time to collect from insurance companies....especially when you say this is what you do for your career. If you are that miserable than find a new career. People and there well being should come first! At least let me finish the program. And be open on Friday's maybe you wouldn't have to charge people so much and always be chasing the money! If you were more professional and nicer to people maybe they would want to pay you. The way you conduct business it is surprising anyone pays you at all!
Clothe yourselves with compassion, kindness, humility, gentleness and PATIENCE ~The Bible"
600,"Hmmm judging from all the reviews I guess the complaints are about the office staff and not the doctors. I just went to this place this morning because I have TMD/TMJ. A few days ago I called the office and I specifically asked if any of the doctors there treat TMJ. The lady said yes and I thought woo hoo I'm in luck. Well I get there and the wait wasn't bad at all. My appointment was at 8:50am and they brought me back to the room a little after 9am. I saw Dr.Nowlin. I told him what was going on and the pain I've been in and how I can barely chew food and open my mouth. At first he was pretty cool but then he starts drilling me with the fact that I need to see a dentist for this. First off I don't have dental insurance so I'm pretty much screwed in that department. And yes I know I need to see a dentist. 

I explained to him because he asked me if I had dental insurance that no I don't have dental insurance and the little I have only covers for cleanings and x-rays. I also told him I am a City of Austin employee but I'm hired on as a temp and we don't get benefits. And the pay sucks also. Well he still tells me you need to get dental insurance and I say how. What I meant by ""how"" is the simple fact I only get oh so much money a month and I have over $500 dollars in bills. Barely enough to buy personal items after all my bills are paid. So how the hell am I going to afford dental insurance and still pay for doctor's visits and all the other crap??? But he just looked at me and laughed and said you have to buy dental insurance just like I have to. Now this is what pissed me off the man sat there and basically insinuated that I'm one of those people that don't work and feel entitled. 

It's not my fault I don't have dental insurance and I have this crappy TMJ that all of a sudden decided it wanted to get worse. And it's not my fault the city hired me on as a temp and don't offer their temp employees benefits. I just didn't like his tone and how he talked to me. He said something else to which I replied my job doesn't pay well like yours. And he said well I went to school longer. Now what the heck does going to school longer have to do with anything??? There are LOTS of college educated people that went to school ""longer"" and they have minimum wage jobs or no jobs. Just because he wanted to be a doctor means NOTHING. And I'm quite sure when he went to his little medical school I'm sure he lived off mommy and daddy especially since his dad was a doctor. So I'm sure whatever insurance and doctor's visits he had was covered. Anyway another thing he said I thought was rude and strange was ""I know you may have problems with your insurance but that has nothing to do with me"" and he threw his hand up while he said that. I thought wtf are you talking about? I never said anything about problems with my insurance or it being your problem.

Anyway the guy is a douche and I will NOT be back to see him! I also didn't appreciate being mislead by whoever that front office person was that said the doctors there treat TMJ. I HATE doctors in general and I am SICK of dealing with them, their crap attitudes, and ditzy office staff. I wish I could just wake up one day with no problems."
601,I've been to a couple people to adjust my back with only great experiences in the past.  I was adjusted by Dr. Knight after my back started hurting.  I hurt much worse the day after and in places that did not hurt before.  I can't walk normally right now.  He was not clear about what the issue was in the first place.  Worst chiropractor experience I've ever had.
602,"Dr. Chokalingam is exactly what I want in a doctor, particularly a doctor whose care is focused on my reproductive health.  She is concise, honest and most of all respects my previous knowledge and interacts with me like a partner in my health-care, not like I am a moron.  She may come across as abrupt to some, but I definitely prefer and appreciate her direct manner, even when it's a little rough around the edges.

As for 6-month pap smears...depending on the circumstance, how could that possibly be a bad thing?  She specializes in treatment of abnormal pap smears and other gynecological issues - so she is focused on early intervention and prevention of more complex problems down the road.  As far as I am concerned, that's a beautiful thing, and more frequent pap smears are a small price to pay for peace of mind."
603,"On the good side, it's a pleasant (if chilly) office, with friendly staff. They have some impressive equipment. They do sedation dentistry for people with dentist phobias.

The bad thing is I think this office is way too aggressive when it comes to dental work, maybe criminally so. Because they do sedation dentistry, my wife went here several times, and had a LOT of costly work done. We sucked up and went along, because we were aware her teeth weren't all that great. Now I wish we had gone elsewhere.

After I got tired of driving all the way to Cedar Park to my old dentist, I came here to try it out. They said I needed two crowns AND some fillings! While in there I heard them tell another patient he was in need of a crown as well! Now, I've had great teeth, and in the last thirty years the only work I've needed was to replace some fillings I got when I was 12. After my initial shock, I got suspicious and sought not one but two more opinions, from another area dentist and my old one.  They both said my teeth were fine, no work needed of any kind. It's been a year now, and I go to another dentist. My teeth? Still fine.

Stay away from these people. They want your money."
604,"I was offered a credit toward an implant. I took the x-Rays for review by other dentists whom offered to do the corrective work to correct the error done by your office. In regards to the dental assistant whom made the comments, I did complain about it to your management immediately after my procedure to have it swept under the carpet by your staff and when I saw the owner several months later and told her/you , I was informed you had no clue. I was told by your other dentist that the work was poorly done, along with the advice I sought out for additional opinions. Please do not twist the truth in order to do damage control. Do what's right. Yes, if I can't seek resolve from you, I will most certainly put in a formal complaint without hesitation. I would also like proof of what you billed my insurance, because it is to my belief I may have been charged for additional chair fees to continuously bond the tooth back on which is unethical. If you notice, there are other reviews whom have had the same experience with your offices as I have. X-Rays and outside opinions from other Dentists don't lie. Until now, your office has not tried to contact me for resolve, but rather try to discredit me on Yelp. Enough said. I will await your response to see if you do the right thing."
605,"Back in 2009 , Dr Bellonzi helped me lose about 30 lbs which is a lot for my 5'3 frame. I did spend quite a bit of money but it was worth it. I don't understand the negative reviews about him. He is the type of person that just tells it like it is! Sometimes he seems a bit harsh, but he also brought out the best of me. Losing weight and sticking to a diet is very difficult. He is very well educated with other health related issues. He is an advocate of daily exercises. I can honestly say this man changed my life..I surpassed my goal weight and realized the importance of taking control of my health. It is now '16 and I haven't gained any of that weight back!!!!! I don't want to post my before/after pictures here but willing to DM them."
606,"It's a mixed bag here. I would generally say the service is either fine, or good -it's significantly better than the Boston BI. You will generally get served somewhat quickly, usually without a long wait. If you show up early, it can actually speed up the service. So, if you are busy and just want to leave ASAP it's on  the quicker end of service. I wouldn't say it was fast tho'. It's just more timely, and the pace has less waiting, boredom , and time wasting. 

I wouldn't say anyone working there was rude or impolite. They check all the boxes as far as being polite to your face, speaking all of the expected choice phrases in order to not be considered rude. But, it feels very mechanical, coached, plastic, fake, hallow, superficial, and empty. They're not rude per se, and they  do and say all of the ""correct"" or ""PC"" things, so you can't accuse them of doing a bad  job. But, so much of it lacks warmth, bedside manner, and you don't actually feel cared about. It just isn't there. You can see the smiles, and hear the ""customer service"" tone of voice. But, it feels more like a drive through service at Jiffy Lube, and you are the car. You don't feel like a human person, but a thing that needs a checklist of things to be performed and spoken to you, then get out, but ""Have a nice day"". 

I wouldn't say any of the personnel working there were bad or negligent people. But, they definitely DO NOT have any wish to connect with ANYONE on an actual personal level. They only want it to seem this way on the surface. I noticed that if they were speaking in a manner that was meant to simulate trust building or relationship relatability, if you actually became candid and treated them as a person, and not submissive to dominant power dynamic of professional above the patient, they would often change the subject, give you a very extra big smile, and try to leave and send you on your way immediately, rather than actually forming a bond of personable trust. 

If you are having surgery, like I did here,  remember to address your fears if u have a special circumstance like if most people have a pair of 2 organs but you only have 1, and they removing giant growths from it, but they've already told you that if it bleeds, they must remove it. Because they can totally forget. In my case I could've become castrated if they removed my ovary, because I only had 1 left. Then I would've been thrust into menopause and my life would've shortened abruptly and thrust into rapid aging. 

This was very concerning  to me. I was having anxiety over this  for months. I also had other complications due to this issue, and the causes were unknown until  after the surgery. 

Everything was a success. I'm fine now. 

But, it bothers me a lot that they felt very cold about this. I felt like just another machine on the assembly line, and not a person. The personal discussions I had with the professionals felt more like a puppet show of telling me things I was supposed to hear, to dupe me to believe everything was fine at the push of a button, or just speak  some specific words and everything was good,, then send me on my way like a drive through. 

But, since my circumstances were unique and complex, it shattered the customer service illusion that they cared, and it wasn't real trust or care. It was people going through the hum drum daily life of a career, and the semblance of a number of things on a resumé. 

It's bothered me a number of times. And I assumed I was  just picky, or overly sensitive, or worried I did something wrong. But, after having spoken with a recent recent professional that spoke too me as a person on the phone, actually cared about me, didn't rush me to hang up or leave, and didn't speak to me with cookie-cutter phrases from a scripted coached list of things to say, or boxes to check  off, I realized that the person I was talking to was a real person whom actually cared about the entire process, the care, the person. And they didn't just put all the burden on me, or pass the buck while ""have a nice day""-ing me. 
So, I felt it validated my feelings of how I felt about this place. 

It has just been a long time since I'd experienced people being authentic, natural, and caring. I can FEEL what people feel. It's called empathy, and it's something the brain does. But when People are saying all the right things on a checklist customer service style and fakely smiling at me, it puts me off.  Because I can't FEEL anything.... but I CAN feel the: 
Oh no! She's trying to get to know me, bond with me, and relate! Get out! Send her on her way! Smile and nod, and get out! 

It's not me being overly sensitive or picky, it's that my sensitivity of my empathy in my brain is functioning fine, and I'm actually picking up the mixed messages. Hence my mixed feelings. 

I hope this information is at least useful and constructive."
607,"Been using Edward for the longest time as my chiropractor.  I was going to refer another client to him until I freaked out and saw the 1 star reviews.  The comments are somewhat justified as you do have wait for your turn there, but maybe because I am always on my iphone, the wait doesn't seem to be that long.  I don't agree with the overall score though.  

I have been to another chiro before as I too was annoyed at the wait time, but the other chiro had no clue what he was doing and ended up busting my balls.  I literally had a hard time performing washroom duties.  Ended up crawling my way back to Edward to get it fixed.  Since I am a regular there, I am not sure if I get treated differently than others, but part of the reason why there is such a long wait time is that Edward seeks to make sure all aspects of your body is fine before you leave, not just the problem area.  In my case, my main area of concern is my back, but he would always ask if my arm was ok since I play a lot of arm-intensive sports.  Compare him to my piece of crap family doctor who booted my ass out after 5 minutes because he claims he's too busy right now to treat me properly.  That family doctor truly deserves one star.  For Edward, if you value quality attention over everything else, then give him a shot.  You will be glad you gave him a shot.

I would certainly recommend Edward to any of my friends who needs chiropractor needs.  In fact, I think I even recommended one of the person who gave him one star on this site.  In due time, I think he will learn to appreciate the value of quality attention as well."
608,"My experience with Mt. Auburn was awesome. I had a problem that didn't warrant going to the ER, and I didn't have a primary care physician that I could see yet. So I drove in; parking is a little expensive, but worth being able to come and go when you want and not waiting for the bus. Plus I think they discount you after two hours if you get your ticket validated. 

Anyway. Right from the West Garage is a short walk to the lobby, where the friendly staff told me how to get to the registration desk (a short walk down the hall). They registered me right away, and instead of having me fill out paperwork, a nice woman typed my information into a computer. Then after another short walk I was in the waiting room at the walk-in clinic. It was only about a 10 minute wait to see a nurse to take my vitals and explain my symptoms, then maybe a 20 minute wait to see Doctor Patrick. 
(Note: This was on a Monday morning, it's probably busier on certain days of the week)

He listened carefully and explained everything clearly. When finished, he printed up some info on my condition to give me with my  perscription. Overall everything was very simple, the facilities were clean and cheery (it looked more like a hotel than a hospital), and I was back at work within a few hours."
609,Doctors are decent - probably been here on average once a year during the past decade - but wait times can be ridiculous. The last time I was there it would have been faster to WALK downtown and get into a clinic. Instead I waited in their lobby with 20+ other sick people for about 2 hours and probably picked up a cold!
610,"I had been going here for a few years and had no issues (other than front desk being SO unfriendly).  I had an old filling that was bothering me so the dentist told me I needed a crown or I was going to need a root canal. So I went in for the crown. It was very stressful and took a long long time. They finally fitted me for the temporary crown which wasn't going on well at all. The assistant told me to bite down and I did and it cracked! She was upset ""Not that hard"" - Yeah, thanks. Anyway, I sat through the whole temp crown creation and fitting again. I then went back to get my permanent crown. It didn't really fit right - my bite felt off no matter how much they adjusted it but I figured i would get used to it. When I got home, the tooth was really sensitive. I found that I could actually touch the tooth underneath with my fingernail and the pain was horrible! I went back and they ""patched"" it with some stuff. It was better but still didn't fit right. The crown never went down to my gums so there has always been a hairline space and the edges are jagged. So 3 years later my bite is still off but they can't seem fix it. I switch dentists (another practice) and she fixes the poor fit a bit so it's a little better. Sensitivity gets worse and after a while I can not longer chew on it (back molar) without it hurting. My new dentist tells me I need to see an endodontist for a root canal and then I will need a new crown due to the leaky margins of the crown that caused the need for the root canal.  So, I got the crown to avoid the root canal and because it was so poorly done, I ended up needing one anyway and a replacement crown in less than 4 years!  And the replacement will be entirely out of my pocket! The poor fit has caused all kinds of jaw/bite issues for me as well. The new dentist tells me that the ""patch"" job they did is a joke because what they used doesn't bond to porcelain that the crown is made of. If it had been done properly in the first place, I would never have needed the root canal, my bite wouldn't be messed up and I wouldn't be out $1000+ to replace it. Avoid this place at all costs."
611,"I was severely injured In Iraq, enough that I was retired for the injuries. I had an appointment with Matt McCarty (he was 48 minutes late), and I have yet to have anyone so disrespectful, dishonest and rude. I came In with all the X-rays, MRI's, medication and my medical records from the army regarding my injury. I was then slammed for severing In the military and was told off the bat that he was gonna do ""not one thing for me"".  He then for 30 minutes told me how the VA was worthless and that he offered his method of treatment. I then asked him to call my doctor and he then with a snooty attitude said ""I could careless what he has to say"". I was In military hospitals for over a month and 1/2 and never have received such treatment from somebody (doctors) as I had that day. Oh, his method of treatment was nothing, because he never stated it to me. He belittled me and kept slamming me for serving in the army. Oh, I take that back he did tell me that i should seek therapy. His staff was also as bad and disrespectful, be warned about the billing department. He charges 250.00 and even higher if you dont have insurance. Tricare (insurance for the military-active duty and retired) was shocked when I spoke with them how high his ""new patient"" fees were and was told that they are looking into why his charges differ. The staff and Mr. McCarty and NOT a military friendly business.  One thing i did find odd was that they did urinalysis for street drugs (i dont do them so i have nothing to hide) BUT the way it is monitored. The container did not have my name and i was not escorted to the latrine. In the military not only are you escorted but viewed (im aware that im no longer in the military). My social, name (first/last) where not even on the container. So i just put it in the basket (empty). No one was there to question why it was empty or view that i put an empty container ""in the basket"". That is just flat out sloppy and another reason to charge you 50.00. I respect those who have an opinion regarding the wars and even the military BUT that should not affect my medical treatment.  I then went to another local doctor, no problems. The odd thing i do see is that he has this ""mightier than god attitude"" and talked down to me (i am 40). I stil to this day am shocked that this business is still there.  Like J.S I should have stood up for myself and walked out, now i know better and plan to do so. The gift of it all is i now have a great doctor and the VA has given me excellent health care. He never came across as a healthcare provider but more as someone that has the authority to ""play god"" and be a big ""bully"" that you had you had to put up with in high school."
612,"I can no longer recommend Dr. Westgate. I have been a patient for many years and I am now looking elsewhere. It appears she no longer has time for her patients and, as a result, I believe patient care has been compromised. I go in regularly but haven't seen the doctor in years. Even though my insurance and I pay to be seen and treated by a doctor, she delegates care to lesser experienced young interns (?). Even when I request her and I'm told I will see the doctor, it's just another different young face and I'm then informed I will have to make another appointment to see her specifically. It's absurd. It seems to be a vicious cycle and a way for them to rack up more money with inferior care. 

It also does not help that the  women at her front desk are rude and incompetent. I feel as though I am just another dollar sign being ushered through a revolving door, which is her practice. In my opinion, there is no revolutionary new treatment or advancement here. No possibility of a cure.  Just drugs and more drug dependency. I hope to find a doctor that is working with cutting edge treatments and will, at the very least, care about the health and quality of life of their patients enough to see them personally. I am saddened and disappointed."
613,"There are some genuine professionals and efficient people at the front desk - James, for one.  I was going to ask who I could contact to send a compliment about his customer service before my entire appointment fell apart.
I was referred to Boston Laser by my PCP. I made an appointment, got the referral approval and received an appointment with the doctor who deal with contact lens issues.
Apparently, nothing was put in my appointment about it having to deal with contact lenses even though that is exactly the reason I was given that doctor because I told them that was what I needed to be seen for.
The doctor was out sick and I was given an appointment with a different doctor who I believed, based upon what I had said, would deal with contact lenses.  I called the referral line from the Boston Laser offices and was given approval and went through the Boston Laser registration process and had the preliminary eye processes with the Boston Laser tech.
She walked into the room after she and I had discussed my issues and told me that she had bad news - that the doctor I was going to see was not in that day.  I told her I knew that and that's why they had placed me with a different doctor.
She came back and second time and told me that she had bad news - that this second doctor did not work with contact lens issues.
I went back to the front desk and told the woman there that I hadn't been seen.  She said that since I had seen the tech that I should have a seat and that the doctor would see me.  I explained that I was told that he wouldn't be seeing me.
She asked if I wanted an appointment with the original doctor tomorrow.  Then she had the supervisor come speak with me.  He essentially told me for what must have been the 5th time that when my appointment was made, it had not been entered as someone needing help with contact lenses. Why each person had to reiterate the offices's mistake to me, I have no idea.  It wasn't that I didn't tell them. It was that they didn't book the appointment correctly.  But they  felt the need to tell me this multiple times.
The supervisor instructed me that they could do an eye exam for me.  This would cost me out of pocket as I had already instructed them when my last annual insurance-covered exam had been. Not sure how this would have been a solution.
He said he could ""fast pass"" me on my next appointment so that I wouldn't have to wait.
I asked how anything would be different with tomorrow's appointment.  He told me that the doctor would not be in tomorrow.  So why did the front desk offer me an appointment on a day in which she is not in?
Inept? Yeah, feels like it.

The offices are very strange-looking, like a movie set from the 1970s.

First impressions are important.  Boston Laser failed me mightily."
614,"I showed up there on Christmas Eve after being told two different times of closing. On the 23rd a woman answer the phone and said that ""we are open until five"" and then on the 24th when I was going to be on my way a man who answered the phone said they close at four. when I confronted him about the woman who said the day prior that they would be open until five he said ""OK well what time are you going to be here"" and I told him I would arrive around 330-345 and he said Someone will be there to assist. I arrived at 345 and the door was locked and lights were off but I saw two people inside with their jackets on. I knocked and the man who answered the door (sounded like the same guy who answered the phone earlier)  said that the system was down and that there was another LensCrafters down the road. I had just driven 45 minutes and I asked if I could just browse to see their selection and he said that because the system is down he couldn't  let me in the store to see any glasses.  All of this was hard to believe considering all the lights were off when I arrived and the two staff had their jackets on like they were ready to leave. Luckily, I went to the other LensCrafters which was great and even suggested that I should report these employees for that. 
I plan to file a complaint with corporate on these two employees for their horrendous service."
615,"The Lake Baldwin VA is a pretty decent location. It doesn't compare to Lake Nona. It looks pretty run down and I'm always afraid I'm going to get stuck in the elevator, but the upside is it's bigger than Orange City, offers more services and employees more staff.....lol

There are four floors which include a pharmacy, audiology, dental, mental health, optometry, and physical therapy etc.

There is also a walk in clinic designated to the green team (each section is designated by a color to help patients easily find their provider).

I've been able to make an appointment with my primary care rather quickly, but if you're going for services such as dental/optometry, at this time, there is a three month waiting period. It's even longer at Lake Nona. Your best bet is to try the Daytona location if you're looking for something other than primary or mental health care."
616,"Ok, the pros.
1)  Dr. Snow is a super-friendly and apparently a very knowledgeable dentist.

2)  His front office staff is incredibly personable and all of them have a super telephone presence.

Ok, so why not a 4-5 star review?  Here goes...
1) My appointment ran approximately 15 minutes late.  (Not a huge deal in and of itself, but these factors add up when the negatives start.)

2) The office doesn't have a wheelchair ramp.  When they had a patient in a wheelchair trying to get in, the office staff's solution was to enlist those in the waiting room (including me) to lift the patient (in her wheelchair) up the steps.

3) The hygenist I had today was simply not up to the task.  Her cleaning was harsh and, at times, uncomfortable. Additionally, her chair-side manner could benefit from more time with Dr. Snow.  When my strong gag reflex presented problems with the X-rays, she was curt at best, although she did eventually come up with the solution of using a topical numbing agent.  Initially, when I told her that my previous dentists used panoramic x-rays on me, she told me that wasn't an option since this office didn't have that machine.  Her semi-lecture on oral hygeine, attempts to push me onto a three-month cleaning schedule, and sales pitch on a Sonicare toothbrush were all more reminiscient of a pushy dental chain than the laid back approach that Dr. Snow appears to provide otherwise.

I wanted to LOVE Dr. Snow's office, but unfortunately, it appears that Yelp might've steered me wrong this one time."
617,"I just wanted to share what a miserable experience I had here several years ago. It was at piedmont location near howell mill. I went in for GI problems, and was told to go take some fiber, when it was not a pooping problem. Jee, thanks, geniuses of the gut. Sigh. I was in need of a gastroenterologist, and couldn't help but laugh when I saw the ad pop up at the top of Google. SO, here's your reward, a little late AGA. Naw, not gonna do that again!"
618,"If I could give a negative star rating, I would. BEWARE of this place!!
The front office staff is awful and the billing department is even worse. Most disappointing was my doctor, Natasya Ikbal. I went in for a procedure that I am not even entirely sure was necessary, but was told after calling the billing office several times that my cost would be under $200. I specifically asked about any other charges and was told that would be it. A month later I was hit by a bill for almost $500, which was in addition to the amount I'd already paid. I was told this was the clinic fee, not the visit fee. I was never even told about the possibility of another fee even though I had asked up front about it. After two months of going in circles between them and the clinic, I was put in contact with the billing head, Pamela. She was condescending and insulting. She flat admitted that it was their mistake, but refused to offer any bill relief. She brought up a procedure I had done 10 years ago under different insurance in a different state and said that was proof that I should know that there could be other charges. First of all, there were no other charges associated with that procedure. Second, going to the doctor does not make me a medical billing expert. Third my past medical history should NEVER have been disclosed to her by Dr. Ikbal. I find that extremely unprofessional and a breach of my doctor, patient confidentiality. Pamela admitted again they were in the wrong, but that they would be using this as a teachable moment for their billing department. I asked why the numerous other complaints on here were not used as a teachable moment. She could not answer that and continued to try and find avenues that would make her feel better about sticking me with this bill. I was also charged for 3 biopsies and I know only two were viable. Dr. Ikbal flat said during the procedure that the first one she took wasn't good and then took two more. When I told this to Pamela, she tried to tell me maybe Dr. Ikbal was referring to an instrument that wasn't good. Again, completely insulting. DO NOT GO TO THIS PLACE!"
619,"I only gave this place one star because Dr. Gragarin was professional, friendly and competent at managing my care. Despite this, Nova's Quincy facility is located in a dirty and smelly office building with cramped waiting rooms that are always crowded. My biggest pet peeve about Nova is that it is almost impossible to schedule an appointment with my psychiatrist since no one in reception picks up the phone (EVER!!). As a patient with a psychiatric condition you never know when you will need to schedule an urgent appointment in order to be assessed and have medications adjusted on an outpatient basis. Thus I recommend that you look elsewhere for your care as this place is essentially useless if you can't schedule an appointment via phone. Long story short...DO NOT GO TO THIS PLACE!!!!!!!"
620,"Hi, I myself am not a patient here, however, my mom is...I have watched my mom go on a rollercoaster with this place! Where should I begin, at first Dr harp and her office seemed like a good place until she indirectly accused my mom of being lazy, she told my mom to exercise, I get it, exercise is good for the body but when she feels like she ran a marathon just walking down to the mailbox and back, she didn't bring up any pools or anything to consider to help her exercise...that's just the tip of the iceberg, when my mom wained herself off of the first anti-depressants because she had her on one that her insurance wouldn't cover and so she had to come in every two weeks to get samples when she shouldn't need to do this at all, later when the family(my brother, stepdad and I) got her to go back in because she was severely depressed, she didn't seem to care much about my mom when my mom and step-dad went in and she threw another anti-depressant(simbalta) and it was working just fine until my mom called in the dose upgrade a month ago and it never got upgraded to the pharmacy and insurance company so she is cold turkey off of them because this office has their heads up their asses!!!! Here she is so depressed that she can't even think right!!! DO NOT GO TO THIS PLACE!!!"
621,"DO NOT go to this place!!! This place is a SCAM!!!
I had a severe pain my teeth and I needed to see a doctor ASAP I called GD in Thursday spoke to someone and confirmed with them that my insurance will be honored and work and cover their clinic after they checked and confirmed my insurance is fine I schedule an appointment, a few days later when I arrived to my appointment the office manager said that my insurance is not covered and I will need to pay $130 do I told him that I called and confirmed in Thursday that my insurance is covered to my surprise he said that the knew since Thursday that Im not covered!!! They never even bothered to call me or email to notify me and made me wast half a day and wait to my appointment only to find out that they want to get $130 to see the doctor which I don't need to pay since I have my insurance to pay for that the office manager was rude and gave me attitude and didn't even offer me an apology a which is a basic of the basic customer service!!!! If they knew that on Thursday that my insurance Is not covered in Thursday they could have notified me and I could schedule appointment somewhere ells but no they wanted to get money out of me so they didn't notify that ill come to my appointment and have no choice to pay in order to see the Doctor since it was an emergency.

 Bottom line this place have no respect for customers and all they care about is get money out of you Be Aware!!"
622,"Do not go to this place!  I wish there were negative stars to give.  The last 2 times I went, I waited in the lobby for nearly an hour past my appointment time before being put in a chair to wait longer.  Now I just called to confirm my appointment for tomorrow after being told on my answering machine that if I didn't call to confirm, there would be a $35 fee... even if I show up to my appointment on time.  So I call, even though they have already sent me 2 texts confirming my appointment.  The first call I get an answering machine and I wanted to speak to a person so I hang up.  When I call back they tell me my appointment time has been changed to 30 minutes later because someone else called to confirm their appointment first.  Basically they schedule 2 people at the same exact time and whoever calls to confirm first, gets that time slot and the other person, even if calling 5 minutes after the first person, gets pushed to a later time.  I guess they figure people don't have jobs and are able to make calls all day to their office and be scheduled when they want to see you and not when you are able to take off work and come in.  When I told her to cancel me, there was no apology or anything, just asked if I wanted to reschedule.  Are you fucking kidding me?  FYI Family Dental, none of this is how you run a business because you just lost mine!!!"
623,"DO NOT GO TO THIS PLACE!!!!
Like the other reviewers with a bad experience... this was a total fiasco. I wish I had read the reviews before I spent $ and time for nothing. My mother got a gift of Botox. The doctor said she would need more to show any difference... 20 units later, there is not even a lick of difference. What a scam! Yes, the people were very friendly, but that doesn't take away from the fact that money was wasted and no results were achieved. NONE, NOTHING, NADA!"
624,"Please...do not go to this place!!! 
I am writing this so you don't make the same horrible mistake I did going to The Joint.

 I had the same chiropractor for 9 years, I went in once a year basically, and walked out pain free every time!! She was a genius at chiropractic work, but she retired. I am a hairdresser, on my feet all day, so my back needs to be in tip top shape. 

I decided to go to The Joint, mainly because of the price, well....you get what you pay for... and then some more... pain... at this fast food chiropractic place!! 
I saw Dr. Lee, told him what my problems were, he did act like he listened, then he stuck two brace things under my tummy and popped my back, and then pulled my leg, that was it. Basically spent 5 minutes with me if that. He did so much damage to my back in those short 5 minutes.
I am not exaggerating, my back has been out for a week and a half, I have an appt. with a reputable Dr. tomorrow. I have never been in so much pain, one night I couldn't even sleep at all!! He did something to my sciatic nerve, he completely put me in the most back pain I have ever been in. It even threw my knee out and all they way down to my foot. I have barely been able to walk properly...So much pain, and I have an extremely high tolerance for pain too. And I say all of this in complete honesty.

Please don't go there if you value your back health!!

Sincerely, 
A person that will never make this horrible mistake again!"
625,"RUN RUN RUN! Do Not Go To This Place! They are crooks, they don't care about their patients at all. This is a puppy mill for dentistry. I went in for pain on my right side and they pulled a tooth on my left side that was not bothering me, which caused me to have to get a bridge $$$ told me I needed a root canal on my right side & crown on a different tooth then gave me some kind of shot to kill the pain temporary making me have to come back. When I came back they refused to give me a root canal or the crown they told me I needed, said I had to get my bridge 1st, mind u I had a temporary bridge in but they wanted to make me pay more $$$$ to get the permanent bridge b4 doing what I originally came in for. All in all they was trying to force me to spend $$$$ on something I didn't need b4 getting what I really needed & what was bothering me. These people are CROOKS. Go at your own risk."
626,"Do not go here! All they care about is money! I have a cracked tooth and was told it's a 5000k repair. I've been saving to afford to get it fixed. I called them on a Saturday of a holiday weekend telling them I have an infection as the side of my face is swollen and I need an antibiotic. They said no we won't give you meds until we see you. Um, hello, you can't see me because it's a holiday weekend so I'm supposed to suffer. Receptionist was extremely rude. They just lost my and my 2 children's business. Do not go to this place!"
627,"* * * *  do not go to this place!!!!! * * * * 

they are crooks and will try to rob you blind!!! 

this office will harass you with phone calls, texts. emails etc. the waiting room is empty for good reason. don't ever trust them with any services. 

they ask you for your social security number.....i've never had a dentist ask for this. how very shady, to say the least. 

********* steer clear!!!!! ********"
628,"If there were a way to give negative stars i would. First of all this clinic's interior is out dated and just gives off the vibe that no one really cares how you feel in it. Well the ""care"" reflects the same.  I saw Leslie Cody a NP there.yesterday and i was horrified at the way she treated me. I went in for a simple check up and physical. When she arrived in the room she was so mechanical and unfriendly, she made little eye contact and just started spouting off questions from her computer screen. She asked me questions i had already answered in my intake form over and over. She obviously hadnt even read it. and you know what i get it shes busy i can have some patience and understanding around that. What i have no patience or Tolerance for is her abhorrent bedside manner and down right cruelty. I told her i was concerned about some weight i had gained in the last year after some very traumatizing and stressful events that had happened. I asked her if we could do some routine hormone and thyroid tests, She coldly with these dead eyes looked at me and said ""well we have a bariatric  specialist here in the clinic who deals with obesity. I was like ""excuse me?"" She was soo unkind it was like she just wanted to lash out at someone. I told her i knew that i could loose some weight but i wouldnt go as far as to call myself obese. She looked at me with this heartless stare and said ""oh you ARE OBESE."" ""Actually you are Borderline morbidly obese!"" ""Im sorry but YOU ARE""
 First of all NO im not!! And second if i was and i had a history of emotional abuse or other trauma that was involved this woman could have pushed me into a horrible sense of shame. She actually did for a minute! the way she responded had no humanity or compassion, it was disgusting!!  The lack of compassion or kindness was remarkable. I stood up and asked her where the Hell she learned bedside manner and told her i was done and i wasnt gonna spend one more second being treated like that. I abruptly went up front to the reception area and told them they were NOT billing my insurance for one penny of what i had just endured. The office manager came out like a doe in the headlights, as i told her what happened not one "" I am So sorry"" came out of her mouth, she seemed like a robot as well, she told me i wouldnt be charged and i promptly got the F#%& out of there went to my car and left sobbing!! WHAT KIND OF HEALTH CARE PROVIDER DOES THAT?!? Im going as high as i can to file reports and complaints against this clinic and that horrible woman. DO NOT GO TO THIS PLACE!!!"
629,"NO MATTER HOW GOOD OTHER PEOPLE SAID THIS PLACE IS, DO NOT GO TO THIS PLACE! I got my wisdom teeth removed at this place, they accidentally broke my other tooth! Instead of telling me the truth, they lied to me that the broken tooth had a severe tooth decay and need to be removed immediately. I guest these people have no souls! Under their clean white clothes are filthy hearts!"
630,Thief! Do not go to this place! I visited this office February 1 this year and was asked to put down$250 deposit prior to my visit. My bill was $209 which left a balance of $41. They told me they would send check to me which never happened. A week later I received a bill of $209 again. When I called they said they needed to investigate this case. Few days later I received an email and asked me to confirm my Home address for the $41 refund. After the confirmation they sent me another email and asked me confirm my payment info if I wanted to expedite the process and have the money refund to my credit card. Of course I trusted them and confirm everything. It's been over 3 months and I haven't heard back from them ever again. Dishonest business!!!
631,"Shady Office Practices--I have reported them to my insurance company.  Alert!  I was told my dental insurance was only a discount card.  It is a dental HMO and I have verified it.  This place told me I will be needing a root canal before checking my tooth that was chipped, they offered in home financing and I wrote them a $300. check.  After they told me my insurance was no good, they wanted to take my blood pressure!  So they took it.  They told me it was high and could not perform on me and to reschedule.  I asked for my check back for no services rendered. The bill mgr replied, she had already ran it and cashed it.  I just wrote the check 5 minutes ago!  (should have knew then)  Another week went by and I stupidly came back!  I came back after seeing my doctor and advised I was fine and never had high blood pressure.  I went back and mentioned being charged for a root canal in the future was ridiculous.  They didn't seem to like that.  So... They took my BP again said it was high and  decided I was not coming back.  I called my insurance co and they said they never did a claim and that they were trying to get paid by their finance company and did not want to submit a claim and be paid direct.  Good Bye!.  Saved me a lot of future issues.  Do not go to this place!  If you don't have high blood pressure you will after leaving here.  One week later I got two crowns from a reputable dentist office,  never had a root canal and never had to finance.  I am smiling now.  I posted a review of the new dentist.  It took 7 weeks to get my $300. refund"
632,"OUTRAGEOUS EXPERIENCE - PLEASE DO NOT GO TO THIS PLACE!

I should've listened to other reviewers and not wasted my time, energy and money but this place is close by and they gave me an appointment instantly so I took my shot - only to regret later.

All Dr. Duffy cares about is how to milk his patients to the fullest. I needed a chiropractor for a minor backache but somehow, was told that my condition is so grave that only visiting him 2, 3 times a week could save me. He was so agitated that I wouldn't commit for a long term program that he refused to treat me even for the day.

Besides aggressive sales pitching, this place also sucks at ambiance and general cleanliness."
633,"DO NOT BRING YOUR CHILDREN HERE FOR BRACES!!
THEY TAKE YOU MONEY AND DONT GIVE A F*#% ABOUT YOU AFTER!!
My son had an adjustment on Sat 8/4/2018 the wire broke so it was stabbing him. So they don't open on Sunday nor do they open on Monday. So today Tues 8/7/2018 they open @11 but website says 9am. Went and was told they couldn't do nothing for him cause ""the people who do braces aren't in, they are in every other day""!! WTF so my son has to suffer. If I could I'll rip that sh@t out his mouth. The Braces is a fucking rip off DO NOT GO TO THIS PLACE! Plus MassHealth did an investigation for fraud! I wish I read that before spending money in the shit hole!!!!"
634,"I hate to review a practice before I even get a chance to meet everyone, especially the doctor, but I feel it is my duty to relay my experience to the general public. 

Before you can become a patient at this practice you have to do a ""meet and greet."" This is an out of pocket expense, not covered by insurance, that is $50. 

I assumed (wrongly) that I would get a chance to meet with the physician in this practice at my meet and greet. That was not the case. I met with a midwife who went by the name ""Bergen."" Her name is not currently listed on their website, so I am not sure if that is her first or her last name. She claimed that midwives and the one doctor in this practice ""are the same."" Though I could tell what she meant by this, they clearly are not the same, as the midwives cannot perform c-sections. 

I know I may be coming across, so far, as someone who may prefer physicians. Actually, that is not the case. As a medical professional myself, I have known doctors that were almost completely incompetent (one, in 13 years) and nurses that knew more, or as much, as the average doctor, seven. Where did I work? A lot of places, but I was most comfortable in Surgical ICU. I know, no matter your specialty, you have to be good at what you do to stay in practice. Otherwise, litigation for incompetence will end you. A midwife who is very well-trained may have better outcomes statistically than most OBGYN's. I care about knowledge and the practitioner's outcomes statistically. That is all.

All that said, my experience at Nurture was as follows. The waiting room was small and adorable. There is a place for children to play. Fantastic. There is coffee and chocolate. What more could a mother want from a waiting room? The office staff were polite. Though the girl at the desk, almost skipped scheduling me for a 12 week ultrasound. Not an OB expert here, but as far as I understand it, that is the ultrasound rather crucial for detecting 95% of genetic abnormalities with the nuchal luceny measurement. She tried to jump ahead to the 16 week mark, though I told her I was 11.5 weeks along in my pregnancy and would need a 12 week ultrasound. 

Anyway, my main beef with the practice, is that the midwife tried to talk me out of going with their practice on 3 separate occasions in the course of 2 different conversations. I actually really liked the staff. I loved how she answered my questions. She had other patients to see, but she still took the time to answer as many she could in person and via a subsequent phone call, but for goodness sakes, let your patients decide what is best for them. 

It was so off and incredibly off-putting to have a medical professional try to talk me out of going with their practice. I could not help but wonder... Am I too high-risk for them? Do they not like people who ask questions? Do they not like that I accidentally took up more than the allotted time for the meet and greet? What is going on with a practice that shoves some people out of the door before they can even get a chance to meet with the doctor? It was just very, very odd. 

I made my decision to not go with this practice after someone in the practice tried to tell me I wasn't for them. I am feeling very confused and rejected. Not what you want to feel when you are pregnant. It was not a pleasant experience. :/"
635,"It's important to me to feel comfortable with my doctors -- especially with regards to dentist, because let's be honest: if you have perfect teeth, cleanings are still a chore, and if you DON'T, then it's even worse! 

I've been to Gentle Dental three times so far. The first was to get the exam and x-rays done, and I have to admit, I was a little worried. The hygienist who did my x-rays scraped up my gums on the roof and floor my mouth by roughly placing the digital x-ray device, and, at one point, knocked it right out of my mouth by accident! If I hadn't reacted by opening my mouth to let it get yanked out, I worry I might have chipped a tooth... which, while I suppose would have been the place to have that happen, I wouldn't want anyway. She'd sworn after she knocked it out, and the swearing itself wasn't concerning (albeit unprofessional), but her demeanor was unsettling. At that point, I wasn't so sure about this. Their prices seemed really reasonable, and I did need to find a new dentist, but yikes...

But then Dr. Ma came in and she was GREAT! One thing I can't deal with at the dentist office is being made to feel awful about the state of my teeth. I swear they're not THAT bad, but I should take better care of them, and it makes me feel nothing but shamed when I get scolded as a grown adult. When I told her that, and then possibly more than she ever wanted to hear about my life (sorry, doc) she was really considerate and made me feel so much more at ease.

So I came back in for my second visit to get one small filling, which ended up being a) smaller than predicted and b) less expensive than it was supposed to be, so that was nice! And Tuesday, I came in to get one more done, and it was also a surprisingly pleasant procedure. 

I can't express I am so happy with my dentist, Dr. Ma! She makes me feel really at ease and is super friendly, and constantly made sure that I felt comfortable. If I could just see her all the time, that'd be A-OK with me. I can't completely give it five stars because of that x-ray thing, but I've had much worse and the price is right."
636,"I have been seeing Dr. Stephanie K. Fabbro at Buckeye Dermatology for the past year and have nothing but good things to say about her. I have struggled with acne for the past 10 years and for the first time in my life, I have clear skin. During my struggle, I have visited at least 6-7 different dermatology offices and have never had any success with anyone else. 

I completed a course of Accutane with Dr. Fabbro that took around 8 months. I have visited this office once a month during my 8 month course, and twice after being off of Accutane. In total, I have visited this office between 10-12 times within the last year. There has only been 1 time that I have had to wait to be seen for my appointment. When I arrive, I check in and am taken back to be seen within 10 minutes. Dr. Fabbro is always on time and very professional. She really cares about her patients and works hard for them. The front desk personnel and other employees are very friendly and helpful as well.

I love this office and recommend anyone to visit Dr. Fabbro. As long as I live in Columbus, I will continue to be a patient here."
637,"Extremely nice front desk girl!! The laser lady wasnt very over the top trying to help though.  I paid for laser acne scar removal and didnt see a difference 1000 dollars later.  They proclaim ""oh yeah this will make a huge difference""  But I didnt see any.  Not sure if the pics are real. Nice people but not impressed."
638,"I made a formal complaint about a dr who came into my appt uneducated on who I was, after 12 years of being a pt there, my dr had stopped practicing. The MA even told me that no dr wanted to see me in the building because of my issue. This dr rushed me and didn't discuss any of my other issues that I was diagnosed with and taking medications for to ensure that everything was ok, which it wasn't. He even needed my help filling out a claim for my work so I could take time off when I have flare ups. After I had to fax in my own papers because they wouldn't. He changed it on me a week later without calling or discussing. I was told I was not allowed to talk to the dr without making an appt for a follow up, literally not even 2 weeks after being seen. At my appt I even had to walk myself out. My formal complaint was taken by someone who was even appalled at how I was treated but I received a letter today telling me that the care I got was fine and they closed my case. I have medications that will need to be refilled this year and I don't feel comfortable even calling this facility nor do I want to have that dr touch my record. If I want a new dr I will have to pay out of pocket, but I was told that a request to have a no charge new patient appt was something they wanted to give me but now I don't think it will happen. I'll be calling and making more of an issue cause no one should be treated by a dr that doesn't know what they've been diagnosed with or what's wrong. Dr. faris has horrible reviews from other facilities he has worked at and providence should be ashamed of hiring him and his rude MA."
639,"Decades after having had the most minimal dental care, my aging mouth needed attention. Reviews for Stonecreek were good and it's fairly close (I live in a rural area where most services are pretty far away) so I made my choice. 
  This will be a mixed review... The facilities are nice. It's friendly, clean and always warm or cool enough. They offer a beverage, that's nice, and a cookie, too (more cavities, to fill! Lol) and there is almost no wait. The dental care is competent. I'm quite satisfied with the work so far.
  Now let's get serious. This has become a never-ending saga. I've been going for over a year now and the procedures go on and on. I still need a lot of work and it is more expensive than I was ever led to believe. They charge for absolutely everything! So far, I've  spent about $30,000 and, as I said, I'm not finished. I believe with the amount I am spending, they could render a few complimentary services. I won't go into detail, but they are nickel and diming me to death, on top of my regular bills. Also, my insurance will not pay for these services and even though they get paid after each procedure, miscellaneous bills still arrive after the fact. They often come from an outside billing service and they always  indicate that they're late. 
  They now plan to send me to a specialist for something I believed was going to be done at Stonecreek. It's not what I wanted. All this will end up costing me as much as if I were buying a house. Is this really fair? Should a person have to mortgage the farm to keep their teeth? I'm not blaming Stonecreek entirely. They're just part of a corrupt system."
640,"I was excited to find a massage place in Bexley, where I live. Turned out it was in a basement office location in a poorly decorated, funky building. Yuck #1.
Yuck #2 was that the massage wasn't very good after I already felt weirded out by the surroundings. 
The best thing I can say was that I got a good price on the massage; they constantly run specials thru deal sites, which should tell you something."
641,"Over the weekend, I had my first anaphylactic reaction to nuts. It was not cool BUT Dr. Shultz got me in first thing Monday morning and got me feeling better almost immediately. He took his time informing me about how I need to prevent this and potentially treat it if it happens again. He was super nice and knowledgeable. I would recommend Dr. Shultz to anyone who needs an allergist or immunologist! A+++"
642,"My 2 children have been patients at Orlando Pediatric Associates for over a year. Yesterday my son fell and hit his eyebrow area on a terra-cotta pot. The gash looked bad enough to require a doctors visit. I called and was I hold for 10 minutes before I could talk to someone. I was told that the only office that take him was the university office. So I drove him 40 minutes out there. Waited another 30 minutes until we saw Dr. Yeager. He said he needed stitches and they would prep the medical supplies needed. He came back 10 minutes later and said that they ""did not have the medical supplies to stitch up my sons wound"". Yes, our pediatricians office did not have the tools needed to do 3 little stitches. We were given directions to a different medical center, they didn't even give my son bandaid or gauze for the gash in his eyebrow. This office is unprofessional, has long wait times, and doesn't check their medical supply regularly. Doctors are nice but all of this issues negate that."
643,"Let me preface this by stating that I *do* like Dr. Scott.  I think he's a good person, and he's a good dentist also.

But his staff ... no.  Just no.

I first went to Pure Dental Health last February because I needed a crown done.  Dr. Scott was a huge help then (I had no insurance at all, so he put me on a payment plan).  So I really have no complaints about the visit then.

However ... I now have insurance through United Healthcare.  He's got a contract with them, and that means they're supposed to accept the payment from the insurance company and not charge the patient for things that the insurance does cover.  This is important.

I went in today to get the oral exam done and x-rays, to find out what I need to have done.  The hygienist, Tiffany (may be incorrect spelling of her name), proceeded to start cleaning my teeth after she took actual photos of my teeth.  I thought, well okay.  But she didn't clean them good at all.  I still have a lot of calculus on my top teeth and definitely in the back.  My insurance covers just *two* cleanings a year, and she botched this first one badly.  I can feel the calculus that's still on my teeth.  So I'm not real happy about that.

Dr. Scott came in and we talked about the fillings I need done, and the fact that I have moderate periodontal disease.  I have some bone loss.  I get that - no one I went to in the past ever treated me for it, so it's been allowed to progress and get worse.  So we talked about what I really need to have done, and he said he'd have his (I'm not sure of her title, something to do with billing but definitely not the billing manager) office staff come talk to me about that.

The woman's name was Sara (may be incorrect spelling of her name), I remember that.  She proceeded to tell me that I would be charged the difference on anything they did to me between what my insurance pays them and what they actually charge.  That is *not* legal, by the way, and yes I have spoken to UH about this and lodged a complaint.  I gave them all the details from today's visit, and confirmed that they are *not* supposed to balance bill me.

Needless to say, I got up and walked right out the door.  I like Dr. Scott, but his office personnel need a lot of educating obviously.  Time to find another dentist ..."
644,"I've been coming here for about a year, and I noticed that there are two kinds of doctors: the ones that seem to care, and the ones that don't (I'll get to this in a moment). Here's what I think...there are some good doctors there. I know there are, I've met them. I just wish I kept their names so that I could request to see them instead of the crappy ones that seem to pop up here and there. If you live near Kerrisdale, and you don't want to go anywhere else because they would be too far for you, make sure that when you meet a nice doctor at this clinic, remember the name and see them more regularly. Otherwise, your experience with this clinic will be soured by the terribly, unsympathetic doctors, who are basically forced to talk to you about ONE concern that you may have. 

The receptionists, in my experience, aren't too rude. They're more straight to the point, and their estimate time of waiting is incredibly accurate. I can't remember when the clinic isn't so busy, but I'd say in the early afternoon. During that time, the doctors seem a bit more willing to discuss with you about your issue(s). 

(STORY TIME. If you already got the point and don't want to read the following below, I don't mind. This is a BAD experience of mine that happened 30 minutes ago)

Speaking of which, when you walk into one of the individual rooms, there's a notice that says, ""If you have more than one concern, please let your doctor know so that we can go over the most important concern today."" I don't go see a doctor very often because I don't have time, and I happen to have more than just one issue on my mind. And today, their notice has been brought to my attention very rudely by Dr. Dlin, whom I find incredibly discourteous and unsympathetic. I mentioned that I have 3 different issues, and he said, ""Okay, what's the first one?"" in a very business-like tone. 

I mention the first one. Interrupting after the first phrase, ""My foot...it's been--"" he says, ""Okay, next one?"" I was speechless. My brain froze for like 3 seconds due to how rude he was. Quickly trying to recover, I mentioned my next one. Again, he interrupts me in the midst of my sentence, and says ""next"". I mention my third one. He interrupts me ONCE AGAIN, and points to the sign that says ""the most important issue..."" and says, ""So what's it going to be? Your foot? Your sleeping problem? Your pills?"" 

I was shocked...I've had bad experiences with doctors before, but this one just outdid every other bad doctors I've seen! 

The positive thing was that he knew what he was talking about...or at least, I think he does. He mentioned a term to me, and he didn't even bother explaining what it was. He just said, ""Okay, we'll get you treated for that, once we have the x-ray,"" and hands me his referral.  He doesn't even explain which ones I should be calling, or if I should even make an appointment at all. He didn't even say ""bye"" or let me know that the session was over. He just left the room and closed the door. I was very confused, so I walked out 2 minutes later and asked the receptionist if I was supposed to get going. Apparently I was."
645,"Unfortunately this was my 4th time over the years. And previously I have had a couple procedures with other oral surgeons. They were fine but Flaggert has ALWAYS been the most excellent - on care/explaining, in the actual work. Another indication is the longevity of his fine staff. Plus they themselves are thorough and so helpful."
646,"TERRIBLE. Terrible. I am still furious about my experience here yesterday, but am going to try to temper my anger and leave a proper, informative review to warn others against coming here.

My husband and I came to Family Tree Dental because he woke up in severe, agonizing pain in one of his teeth. They were the first place that I found that could see him the quickest, and I was super grateful just to get him an appointment. 

$150 later for a 18 x-rays (when he only went in for one issue / pain in one tooth), they told him that he had a small cavity that they could fill in that tooth, and proceeded to try to tell him that he needed THOUSANDS of dollars worth of other work on the rest of his mouth. He kept pleading with them to help him with just that one tooth because he was in so much pain (literally crying), and it seemed like they were unwilling to even do that until he agreed to the rest of the work. It really felt like were trying to bully him into agreeing to do more work than he needed, and it really seemed like they were trying to take advantage of the pain he was in and desperation we were both feeling to fix the issue. 

He told me all of this and I called my regular dentist (Dr. Root, who is AMAZING) and they said they could squeeze him in the next day (when I knew for a fact that they were completely booked), and that all of this sounded fishy. So we just walked out.

So, today we went to Dr. Root's office, where they did a quick single x-ray of the tooth (with an exam it was only $60, btw) and found that he has an abscess and that the tooth is DYING. DYING. 

So, let's review: 
 
1. Family Tree Dental said that my husband's incredible pain was due to a ""small cavity"" which WAS NOT EVEN THERE and completely missed the fact that the tooth itself is dying - he needs a root canal and to have the tooth probably removed completely. This is after 18 x-rays. Not to mention that an abscess can be life threatening - so this is a very, very serious issue they completely missed.

2. They offered NO COMPASSION (if anything, they were downright rude) or help with the pain, which the folks at Dr. Root could not believe. Dr. Root's office gave us a prescription for antibiotics and pain meds to tide him over until we can have the procedure done, neither of which was even mentioned or offered by Family Tree. 

3. When someone is in pain, crying, desperate, and a place tries to take advantage of that fact by getting them to agree to work that has nothing to do with the issue they came in for (not saying that some of the stuff they mentioned wasn't needed, but we had a very immediate, near emergency issue that they more or less glossed over / ignored), STAY VERY FAR AWAY. 

I hate to leave such a negative review for a place (and never really have), but this was ridiculous. They might be fine for routine dental work, but if you're in any kind of pain or have an emergency situation, expect no sympathy from this office, and if anything I'd honestly be very weary if they even know what they are doing."
647,Going to a doctor is bad enough. Going to a urologist is even worse. Having all my personal data stolen on top is adding insult to injury. I never dreamed in a million years that our personal information was being stored in some insecure database. I got a letter stating that all my personal information was hacked from their system. I haven't gotten a single follow-up notice: is someone investigating the hack? Has my identity been stolen? Never again.
648,"Okay this is the best Gynecology office I have been to. The staff is phenomenal and Dr. Day herself is incredible. She is so knowledgable about the medicine she practices and makes sure she explains everything until you understand.

On the day of my IUD insertion I was incredibly nervous. I had seen what my friends went through when they had theirs inserted and was very anxious while waiting in the exam room. Dr. Day was so comforting and understanding. Moreover, the insertion was A BREEZE. She is incredible and knows what she is doing I cannot stress this enough. 

This office is a no brainer. Go here. I'm serious."
649,"In short, my experience with them indicates incompetence, outright fraud, or both, which almost cost me thousands of dollars in unnecessary fillings on 15 of my teeth. I do not exaggerate. I cannot stress this enough. Stay away, or you might spend thousands of dollars on countless fillings that you don't need at all.

I'm admittedly writing this over 3 years since the incident, but it was so ridiculous that I feel a moral obligation to make others aware. As it is, I wish I had posted this review a while ago when I meant to, but I kept putting it off, as I wanted to take lots of time to write a fair review that was completely clear on what happened.

I went to Downtown Dental Studio after not having been to a dentist in 5 years. Upon arrival, I told them it had been 3 years (as I thought at the time) and they proceeded to examine my mouth and take X-Rays. Dr. Szary, (or possibly the hygienist, I'm not completely sure) came in to go over the results. She explained I had cavities scattered throughout my mouth on 28 surfaces across 15 teeth, and she showed me how to find the ones between teeth (on the proximal surfaces for those who know the terminology) in the X-Rays. I was told fillings for all of these would be $3442.

Naturally, I was stunned, and wanted a second opinion. I shortly thereafter went to a dentist who is a family friend (read, trusted) and she was clear that I had NO cavities. She said MAYBE I had a single one brewing in one wisdom tooth, but that was it.

At this point, I was furious, and wanted to write a scathing review here on Yelp. However, I also wanted to make sure I didn't somehow misunderstand what Downtown Dental was saying. I called them back and asked to verify the diagnosis and that work was needed. The hygienist I spoke with said she definitely sees 4 cavities on the X-Rays that were ""into the dentin"" and those, at the very least, absolutely needed fillings immediately. I brought up the second opinion I got. She was surprised to hear that, and still said she thought I needed fillings. I will say that she was very nice, and sounded sincere in her diagnosis.

Several months later, I found a different local dentist, who was recommended by a friend, and he also examined my mouth and found no cavities. I should add that both this dentist and my family friend looked at the very same X-Rays that were taken by Downtown Dental, and they both said there were no cavities apparent from the X-Rays. I pointed out the ""cavities"" that were shown to me at Downtown Dental on the X-Rays, and my family-friend dentist said those are artifacts of the photo - not actually cavities.

If the second and third opinions weren't enough, it has now been over 3 years, and I have developed only two cavities since then: one of which was the one that was ""brewing"". I hadn't gotten a cleaning/checkup in at least 1.5 years, so that probably didn't help. None of the other ""cavities"" found by Downtown Dental have caused me any pain or trouble of any kind, so I think it is safe to say they didn't exist.

In summary, if I had trusted Downtown Dental, I would currently have fillings in 15 of my teeth (or, at the very least, 13 teeth) that I don't need, and would have spent thousands of dollars to do so. Again, I do not wish to slander anyone, so I am not making anything up or exaggerating. I still have my records from the incident which I just checked, so I am not going off of faulty memory regarding the numbers."

After the checkup was over, I was told I had cavities on 28 surfaces across 15 teeth, and was showed the ""cavities"" on the X-Rays. I was told fillings for all of these would be $3442.

651,"WALKED OUT OF THE EXAM ROOM AFTER AN HOUR AND 15 MINUTE LONG WAIT. HORRIBLE EXPERIENCE. 

Was in last night. Absolutely no warning on how soon I would be seen. Guy at the front desk absolutely reeked of cigarettes, was extremely rude about why I had come in to the center (was laughing, being very short and almost standoffish) and was just overall extremely unprofessional. His biker jacket and helmet were spread across the counter. Did NOT seem like a medical office. I CANNOT STRESS THIS ENOUGH.

I sat in the patient room for over an hour simply waiting for someone to come into the room to check on me. It was DIRTY. There was filth on the walls, small pieces of some sort of plastic trash on the floor and areas of the walls where paint had been scraped off. Not ONE TIME did someone come into the room to make sure that I was okay. However, I could hear FastMed employees in the hallway saying ""Only two hours left!"", ""Thank God!"", ""I can't WAIT to go home"". It was SO unbelievably unprofessional. Didn't seem like they cared about patients in the building, AT ALL.

After waiting for over an hour and 15 minutes, I decided to just get up and leave because no one had checked on me for 45 minutes and was just completely fed up with the experience through and through.

Being in the building literally gave me an anxiety attack. The front desk worker being rude, the lack of ""care"", the piercing silence of the building and the dirty state of the rooms- the person that I was with literally compared the experience to BEING IN A PRISON.

If I could give this place a zero, I would give it 0/5 stars. One of the worst medical experiences of my life. I've been to plenty of other ""fast med"" places and they have handled my cases quickly and professionally. Not here. STAY VERY VERY FAR AWAY! Go right up the street to the other place. At least you won't feel bullied when you talk to the employees."
652,"My mother recommended Dr. Hartley for my breast reduction surgery after seeing him for her mastectomy and (botched) reconstruction surgeries. Before the surgery, I was told that he would even my breasts out so they were the same size and that if I followed all aftercare instructions, I would have minimal scarring. Dr. Hartley must have forgotten that we discussed making my breasts the same size, because that sure as hell didn't happen. Now, a year later, my nipples don't fall in a natural position on my breast (they aren't even symmetrical), I had to entirely take out my nipple piercings and let them heal because he put them back askew, I have a giant red scar on one side (the silicone tape they gave me wouldn't stay on for more than 10 minutes at a time), and I've lost most feeling in my nipples and I've entirely lost feeling to the sides of my breasts. 

My mother had been through numerous surgeries through Dr. Hartley as well, and every single time she has gotten a horrible infection, to the point where she can't actually have reconstruction surgery at all and she has an open wound that's been struggling to heal for literal years. 

Honestly, plastic surgeons should be required to have before and after photos of every single patient they have along with notes from the patient detailing what was requested and how well they believe the surgery went. 

I can't be topless at all anymore because of how frankenstienian my breasts look. Do not go to Dr. Hartley, I cannot stress this enough."
653,"Dr. Shamloo is a fantastic chiropractor. I cannot stress this enough. I came into the clinic with chronic back pain and began feeling significant improvements by my second session. But not only do I feel better, but I know why I feel better. This is because Dr. Shamloo takes his time to carefully educate his patients about the science and methodology behind upper cervical care. I highly recommend anyone looking into chiropractic care to give Dr. Shamloo a call."
654,"I stared seeing Dr. Soyer a month or so ago. I went in with crippling pain and had no range of motion in my neck. Dr. Soyer has not only gotten my range of motion back, I also have very minimal pain. My quality of life has improved greatly and I feel better then I have in a long time. 

He has made several suggestions of things to help between adjustments and has listened to me and provided excellent information and resources.

I was referred to him by two other patients and am so glad I was. He's patient, knowledgeable, and an excellent Dr."
655,"I'm a new patient of Dr. Soltys, who I hold in high regard. I've had some recent issues with the office so I thought it more appropriate to post my review to Barton Creek Eyecare, rather than Dr. Soltys. (Both are listed in Yelp.)

Dr. Soltys was recommended to me as someone who has had success fitting post-operative patients with contacts. I'm delighted with his work and anxious to see if I can have normal vision again without glasses.

My issues are with the office staff. First, we had a glitch with validating my insurance, so I had to pay out of pocket and then file a claim myself.

Had a miscommunication on the time of my second appointment which resulted in a 1 week delay. (That very well could have been my fault.) 

After the contact fitting appointment, Dr. Soltys said my lenses would be available the following week. No call in 10 days so I called them and left a voicemail to ask the status. Placed another call and left an additional message a few days later. Also tried texting without luck. They never did respond to any of my communications, but finally did leave me a voicemail to ""remind"" me that my contacts were ready. I rechecked the call history on my phone and found no prior calls from their office. All told, about 4.5 weeks from initial visit to contacts provided. I saw a handwritten call log stating that they called 12 days earlier but left no message.

Had a bit of sticker shock at paying $400 for 2 soft contacts. I understand that they are special. Wish Dr. Soltys or someone there would have given me a ballpark figure before hand to guide my decision. Also the office staff failed to check my insurance coverage for the contacts, so I'm back to filing my own claim again. (They are out of network for VSP, so I will likely pay out of pocket for everything.)

I asked for a printed copy of my contact prescription, since I'm sure I can find the contacts for half of that online. Thank goodness Texas law gives patients access to their own precriptions. However, on the way out I noticed that the prescription showed ""last edited"" with today's date and that the numbers on the prescription were transposed with those on the contact vials I recieved. When I broupght everything back and showed them the mistake, I asked for clarification on which values were correct. I really didn't get a clear resonse; they just changed the values and printed out a new prescription. [Assuming their office is computerized, my prescription should have already been in the system for several weeks. There seems to be no reason for a recent edit. Could it be that the transposition was intentional to make it more difficult for me to source lenses elsewhere?]

Finally, I was really surprised that they didn't offer me the opportunity to put on the new contacts to see if they did, in fact, fit and work as expected... especially given the uncertainties that were raised.

BOTTOM LINE: Good doctor, but a dissapointing experience overall due to mistakes and poor service from staff member(s). Either way, I will probably be shopping for a new ophthalmologist."
656,"I was referred to the Oregon GI clinic about a year ago and have had nothing but bad experiences. I have been dealing with IBD for 17 years now and know that all this clinic cares about is pocketing money. I'm in the process of switching to a new clinic now so they have denied me a refill of a medicine I've been taking for 3 years knowing that I am in dire need of this. They have charged me for every possible thing you can imagine. I was charged $25 for a doctor note for my work, I was charged $30 to have my files faxed to the new doctor. My checkup bills were OUTRAGEOUSLY over priced compared to phenomenal doctor care I have received in California. There is also a special $200 charge on their bills to see the actual doctor who never spent more than 5 minutes with me. I have been dealing with the most extreme symptoms I've experienced in these 17 years to be flat out told ""it's in your head and we won't be writing any prescriptions for pain killers because we don't believe in them."" I've been out of work for 2 weeks and in and out of the ER yet they're refusing to refill my medications. Thank god for a primary care doctor who actually cares about my health and well being! 

If I could give this clinic ZERO stars I would. Please don't waste your time or money at this clinic, they will never invest in your health. I have never received such terrible care from a GI clinic in my life."

658,"I highly recommend Dr Alicea!!  His office got me in first thing in the morning for a painful abstraction followup that I had the previous week. (Abstraction was with another Dr in Melbourne that I will not return to). Dr Alicea added a medicine and then bone graph the abstraction area. He has good bed side manners, is friendly and informative and did not rush me through the process. He also checked and when I felt pain he made sure to give me another shot before continuing procedure.   Will be returning to Dr Alicea in 4 months for a tooth implant.  His assistant Breanna was also very friendly and helpful explaining any further questions I had regarding the procedure and followup care.  Highly recommend this office to anyone looking for a young, caring, and competent doctor.  Also with Covid times Dr Alicea, Breanna, all office staff wore a mask at all times."
659,"I didn't think this doctor was in business anymore, but I Googled her after I found an old bill that I found from 2002. I saw the review by Dana H. and laughed my a$$ off!

So I, also, found this dentist through my insurance network. My experience started in a similar way with the unfriendly staff member. The guy who worked there was nicer, but, ultimately, he still didn't resolve my issue(s).

The first time I went in, I went for a cleaning. Everything was find and dandy. The x-rays and cleaning went fine. I had a cavity on one of my molars, so I set up an appointment to come back for the filling. They asked if I wanted amalgam (silver) or the composite (tooth-colored) filling. I said I wanted amalgam since it was covered under my insurance. They gave me literature on AMALGAM fillings and I was on my merry way home.

The second, and final, visit, I went in for my amalgam filling and the doctor and her assistant worked on my molar. When they were done, the assistant mentioned what happens with composite fillings. I was wondering why she was telling me this information. I asked for a mirror and saw that they gave me a composite filling! I had never gotten one before, so I didn't know the procedure. I figured she was a young dentist at the time, so she had new technology on how to do amalgam fillings. I was so upset! I said I didn't ask for that. She said it was written on the chart. I pulled out the literature about amalgam fillings that they had given me on my first visit. They were completely shocked at their mistake. After months of phone calls, they eventually fixed it and there was a credit of maybe $20 on my account. Months went by and I kept waiting and waiting for them to send me my refund, but I never received it. 

Finally, one day I called and they said they ""fixed my account"". I asked when I could expect my check and they said there was actually a balance of $5.00 and as a courtesy, they just wiped off. They said there WAS a credit of $20.00, but then there was a charge of $25.00 from an appointment for which I never showed up! At that point, I was so furious, but I held in my rage. I made sure that there was no balance and asked them to send me something saying that there was nothing due. I received it in the mail and have kept it ever since, just in case they tried to come back and say that I had a balance. I told all of my family never to go there. 

To be fair, the doctor was actually nice and she did a pretty good job so I gave two stars instead of one, but the administration messed up my whole experience. 

In addition, in 2004, I found my old dentist that I LOVE!!! They are brothers: Drs. David and Kelly Harden. I went to them when I was still in high school. They are awesome. Recently, I changed insurance and had to find another in-network dentist. Dr. Arias' office on Colonial (A Family Dental) sucks, too. They told me that my daughter didn't have any cavities, but she actually had TWO of them. They said for new patients, they do not promise a cleaning. My husband and I were outraged. The lady asked if we wanted to schedule a cleaning which meant that we had to pay for a separate appointment. My husband declined and we left.

I am never leaving Dr. Harden again! Try them out. They are PPO only, though, but their customer service is excellent and their dental work is superb!"
660,"DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME OR MONEY

I purchased a 2.5hr couples massage class voucher which included a Rose Petal Footsoak, A glass of champagne, and light appetizers per the voucher. Before I bought the voucher I called and checked their Vday availability. They had none and scheduled me for the Saturday following Vday. Cool, me and my honey cozied up that morning and were getting ready to head over when I got a call to cancel my appointment because of a family emergency. On their self-proposed ""over booked weekend"" there is an emergency that no one could cover for. hmmm, so now the only Vday plans I had were blown with not even an apology. 

I called Livingsocial 5xs over the course of 2 weeks and begged, BEGGED for my money back because the owner was not returning my calls to reschedule. When I was finally able to reschedule I took my best friend for a couples massage 3 weeks later, and thats when the real fun began. 

1st

The walls are paper thin and you can hear every conversation. Then the toilet was backed up for myself and my friend so we both wound up running out of the bathroom before the toilet waste wound up on the floor. We alerted staff who did nothing about it. 

2nd

The footsoak was in a basket with a black garbage bag inside and thats not quite large enough for one set of feet much less two. My friend and I sat uncomfortably in chrome and leather chair that didnt recline, it was more of a doctors waiting room chair. We were both trying to keep our feet from sitting right on top of each other while we sat and watched the water get cold. The appetizers were LITERALLY (no exaggeration) was 2 strawberries, about 8 grapes and 3 blueberries. A teeny bowl of fruit and i paid $125 for not even enough fruit for two people. Pardon for me expecting at least some finger sandwiches from Publix. I mean really! 

3rd

The massage was ok, but you could hear every conversation in other rooms, at the front desk, when people answered cell phones etc. There was no music playing! I will NEVER pay this much for a  LivingSocial voucher again. Ive had some great experiences and some AWFUL ones with the vendors. This one TOOK THE CAKE, please save your money, time, and disappointment."
661,"I've been using this clinic for several years, and quite often I've not had any issues. They often will fill their patient quota early in the day which can be a nuisance if you can only get there in the afternoon. That said, if you show up first thing in the AM, it's not a problem. The receptionist staff are helpful, considering how busy it can get in there! 

I have to say though, I was sorely disappointed the last time I was in. The doctor came in and spent less than 5 minutes with me. I had explained that I had had a chest pain and cough for nearly 6 weeks, having spent time taking different cough syrups, and home remedies. Her answer to me was to use cough syrup and gargle with salt, and she said that as she was WALKING OUT THE DOOR. I'm sorry, but I sat in the waiting room, and you can't take 5 minutes to sit and talk and listen to the patient. Needless to say I saw another doctor at another clinic. Funny, they diagnosed me with a lung infection and oh, the medication they prescribed has ACTUALLY worked. I won't be coming back here any time soon."
662,"The thought of having teeth yanked out of my mouth is a thought that strikes fear into my heart. I have had braces and my orthodontist (back in Hong Kong) said that I have to have my wisdoms removed ASAP or I'd wind up undoing all the work that he's put in over the one and a half year that I've had braces. He actually mustered up the humour to say that my wisdom teeth were a ""ticking time bomb."" That left me very worried, but since I was told this information a week before school started again, I put this off until the end of the semester.

Since I usually get most of my dental work done during my visits to Hong Kong (since most of my patient files are still there), I was at a loss for who I should see for wisdom teeth removal. It didn't help that my parents were also warning me that I may experience permanent nerve damage should the operation went wrong. Quite predictably, the recommendation for Dr. Chow came from the family dentist (in Vancouver), who without hesitation, issued a referral to Dr. Chow, reassuring me that Dr. Chow is one of the best in the field in Vancouver.

He wasn't kidding. Dr. Chow is incredibly efficient, from the initial consultation to the subsequent operation, he was always very assuring, and took the time to form concise and informative answers to the concerns that I had. I should also mention that he managed to remove all four of my wisdom teeth in half an hour, which seems really fast. I was unfortunate enough to have a complication of a swollen jaw, which prevented me from closing my mouth for about a week following the surgery- that made talking quite difficult, and they ""Why the long face?"" cropped up in pretty much every conversation with family, but Dr. Chow's staff of nurses were incredibly helpful throughout the process, having provided reminders before the consultation and operation, and even managed to decipher what I was trying to ask them over the phone following the operation, when my jaw was completely swollen. To explain how hard that is, imagine not being able to make a ""sh-, ch-, t-"" sound when you're talking.

I would say I'd come again, but considering how this is a dental practice, that's probably a bad thing, so the best I can do is recommend Dr. Chow for dental surgery."
663,"I'll just start this review by saying Dr. Campaigne is the best doctor I have ever had. 

She was one of the five providers at her old practice, OBGYN North.  In this practice, OB patients see a different provider at every appointment, so they will ""know"" the person that delivers your baby.  Then whoever is on call at the time is the lucky person to catch your newborn.

Throughout my pregnancy, I loved meeting with Dr. C (when I was lucky enough to have her.) She is VERY down-to-earth, will respond to your concerns, and has a warmth about her that is remarkable.  When it came closer to the ""big day"", I began to pray not-so-secretly that she would deliver my child.  The time came, the stars aligned, and DR. C brought Elise into the world.

Without going into unnecessary and graphic detail, let's just say Dr. C did a great job with the delivery.  All of my wishes were listened to and respected and everyone came away healthy.

A few months ago, I found out Dr. C was no longer with OBGYN North. I was understandably distraught. Where did she go? Was she no longer practicing medicine?  Unlike any doctor./patient experience I have had before, I found her on Facebook.  She explained she was setting up a new practice in North Austin in late July.

This brings me to my recent checkup at Nurture.  One of the midwives and several of the nurses from OBGYN North joined her at this new space.  They describe it as ""boutique.""  The place doesn't really feel like a doctors office with the glass window and all of the papers informing you of insurance rules and that payment will be due at the time of service. (Duh.)

Instead, there is water infused with cucumbers, fresh fruit and little candies.  The walls are painted a calming taupe and the space is decorated with interesting and thoughtful art pieces. A friendly receptionist greeted me and assisted with the paperwork.  And as always, Dr. C behaved more like a friend than a doctor.  

If you are looking for an OBGYN in the North Austin area, don't walk, RUN to Nurture."
664,"I was so excited to have a new doctor through new insurance I received. My first visit was fully covered through insurance called a annual exam. While talking to the girl during scheduling she seemed confused and not sure what I was asking. 
Once I arrived they checked my ears and blood pressure (didn't check my knees or temp) 
Since this was my new doctor while she was doing her ""exam"" I mentioned that I have a preexisting back disease and that I was happy to be here because Kaiser Permanente never did anything for me. 
DONT DO THIS. 
Or you will receive a $250+ bill in the mail cause at that point it turns into a doctors visit. 
I was so disappointed to call the billing customer service and hear their notes say the doctors notes state I came in and they ""fixed"" my back condition. After talking with billing they contacted the doctor to verify the visit and she pushed back saying it was a doctors visit. so I'm stuck paying a $250 bill. 
I was so happy but now don't want to ever come back. I don't trust any of these people ESPECIALLY with my health. 
Providence is a joke.  Truly ."
665,"I chose Dr. Middleton because of the reviews on here.  I was hopeful of finding a Doc that I could keep forever.  No such luck.  Making the appointment and the office experience was unremarkable.  The reason I am on here looking for a new Gyno is because I am unhappy with Dr. Middleton.  I am considering trying someone else in the practice but wonder if it will be akward.  I was experiencing probems with my period and she told me that I am starting menopause.  I told my GP and he said ""let's do a test.""  I was surprised Dr. Middleton would say such an important statement without testing when there is one available.  I went back another time due to a problem and again I felt like she ""guessed"" at my problem and did not do enough to investigate.  When she guessed this time I told of my experience that contradicted her assumption and she blew me off.  I do not feel like she cares about her patients at all.  Maybe she has been at it too long and is jaded or something.  I don't feel like I got the help I needed and now I'm back in the same boat looking for a good Doctor."
666,"I found the office personnel here to be incompetent, impatient and rude. I found the doctor to be too enthusiastic about rushing to surgery and very misleading in expectations. 

After three surgeries and several painful procedures, I still had the same problem (loud snoring). I called to say I was unhappy with the results and asked to speak to or see the doctor for free (after paying for all the initial visits, surgeries, etc.), but was told they don't guarantee results.

I heard this ""we don't guarantee results"" about 10 times in the brief conversations with staff AFTER the surgeries, but not once beforehand. Before the surgeries he said (direct quote), ""By Christmas you'll be so happy, you'll come in here and give me a hug!"" There was a lot of this talk, ""You'll love me when this is over!"", ""You'll be so pleased!"" etc. No talk of, ""Prepare yourself, this may not work.""

When I called to say it didn't work I was told by someone who was never in the room during a single one of my appointments,  ""No one every told you it was 100%"". In fact, in a way the doctor did say this. I said I felt the snoring was coming from my nose, not my throat. He said this was impossible. He said if he removed my uvula I couldn't snore because there would nothing to vibrate. So, I had it removed. It didn't work. 

I'm not blaming the doctor that the surgeries didn't work, but I do blame him for deliberately misleading me and then dropping me when things didn't work out.

Do not expect to be treated as warmly and enthusiastically when treatment doesn't work. At that point you will be ignored."
667,"I would like to start by saying I think that this is a GREAT place to birth per the other reviews, and that the midwifery seems fantastic. The ""physicians"" not so much. I ended up in the hospital, along with my 4 year old daughter because of being misdiagnosed for over a week with pneumonia. What a horrific experience. DO NOT go here for medical treatment. Use the midwives only.

My daughter was seen when I went in for the appointment I finally was seen and my entire family was with me. My daughter was ill and I asked that they check her. The doctor said she is fine, just have her rest and give her fluids. She may not have been ""billed"" as seen but she was seen."
668,This place is the absolute WORST dental experience I have ever had. I have lived in many cities with many different dentists and I have never seen such an office of rookies in my entire life. I wouldn't continue my treatment plan here even if they PAID me. My suggestion to reviewers would be to find a dentist who has had a solid family practice for 10 plus years. These kids playing doctor butchered my mouth and the office staff is very unprofessional.
669,"The nurse never entered in my daughter's shots in the records so now I'm on this hunt for that list of shots. This place is archaic. So the only way was to leave a message via the receptionist who will pass it to whichever nurse is available. And if that note is lost, I have to call back and go through the process again. Why she can't pass it to my daughter's nurse I don't know. Why there is no voicemail for her nurse or dr I don't know. Why they still use post it's go relay messages I don't know. 

This place is filled with (for a lack of better word) ""ghetto"" clientele. Of course I'm completely superficial in my statement and can only judge what is seen upfront. Can judge me or just see for yourself. 

But that isnt why we switched. The drs didn't seem very knowledgeable, the nurses recorded the wrong weight for my daughter and we had to push for the dr to redo it bc she kept insisting it's right, nurse forgot to enter my daughter's shots in the records, and anywhere that still does post it messages should be due with."
670,"I hate to review a practice before I even get a chance to meet everyone, especially the doctor, but I feel it is my duty to relay my experience to the general public. 

Before you can become a patient at this practice you have to do a ""meet and greet."" This is an out of pocket expense, not covered by insurance, that is $50. 

I assumed (wrongly) that I would get a chance to meet with the physician in this practice at my meet and greet. That was not the case. I met with a midwife who went by the name ""Bergen."" Her name is not currently listed on their website, so I am not sure if that is her first or her last name. She claimed that midwives and the one doctor in this practice ""are the same."" Though I could tell what she meant by this, they clearly are not the same, as the midwives cannot perform c-sections. 

I know I may be coming across, so far, as someone who may prefer physicians. Actually, that is not the case. As a medical professional myself, I have known doctors that were almost completely incompetent (one, in 13 years) and nurses that knew more, or as much, as the average doctor, seven. Where did I work? A lot of places, but I was most comfortable in Surgical ICU. I know, no matter your specialty, you have to be good at what you do to stay in practice. Otherwise, litigation for incompetence will end you. A midwife who is very well-trained may have better outcomes statistically than most OBGYN's. I care about knowledge and the practitioner's outcomes statistically. That is all.

All that said, my experience at Nurture was as follows. The waiting room was small and adorable. There is a place for children to play. Fantastic. There is coffee and chocolate. What more could a mother want from a waiting room? The office staff were polite. Though the girl at the desk, almost skipped scheduling me for a 12 week ultrasound. Not an OB expert here, but as far as I understand it, that is the ultrasound rather crucial for detecting 95% of genetic abnormalities with the nuchal luceny measurement. She tried to jump ahead to the 16 week mark, though I told her I was 11.5 weeks along in my pregnancy and would need a 12 week ultrasound. 

Anyway, my main beef with the practice, is that the midwife tried to talk me out of going with their practice on 3 separate occasions in the course of 2 different conversations. I actually really liked the staff. I loved how she answered my questions. She had other patients to see, but she still took the time to answer as many she could in person and via a subsequent phone call, but for goodness sakes, let your patients decide what is best for them. 

It was so off and incredibly off-putting to have a medical professional try to talk me out of going with their practice. I could not help but wonder... Am I too high-risk for them? Do they not like people who ask questions? Do they not like that I accidentally took up more than the allotted time for the meet and greet? What is going on with a practice that shoves some people out of the door before they can even get a chance to meet with the doctor? It was just very, very odd. 

I made my decision to not go with this practice after someone in the practice tried to tell me I wasn't for them. I am feeling very confused and rejected. Not what you want to feel when you are pregnant. It was not a pleasant experience. :/"
671,"I had LASIK done on Tuesday this week with Dr. Violin and Elaine. Both of which were fantastic. Here are my thoughts:

1) LASIK is somewhat competitive with companies so if the first thing you think about is cost, you can negotiate a good price - always negotiate because there is a good deal out there somewhere. I went for the free consult on Thursday 8/9/2012 and they scheduled my procedure for the following Tuesday - which is beyond awesome.

2) Elaine (nurse) - was very friendly and extremely knowledgeable. She will return calls very promptly. She laid out all the good and the potential bad so that you have nothing to imagine after the procedure. Elaine will certainly make things much more comfortable. 

3) The procedure - FAST. So you get this done in Quincy. Parking is terrible so get there a few minutes early. They will give you ""something nice"" to help you relax. The total time of laying on the procedure bed to the time you stand up and leave is seriously 5 minutes. The laser process is about 2-3 minutes total time for both eyes. They will talk to you throughout the procedure. Awesome. A lot of pressure but you can expect that. 

4) Post-op - within a half hour after the procedure, the drugs wear off and it becomes extremely uncomfortable. All you want to do is close your eyes and rip something close to you in half. Hopefully you won't get stuck in traffic as I did. Take your happy pill and some NyQuil and sleep it off for a few hours. You will wake up and start to see nice. The next day I was seeing 20/15. Light sensitivity is very annoying but I can put up with it for that it's great to not need corrective lenses. The light sensitivity will make lights halo or glow a lot and certainly make things a little fuzzy. Just wear a hat for a few days. 

5) Final words - I am on day 2 post-op. I am still sensitive to light but I see great. Better than great. My left eye is more sensitive than the right but I guess that is normal. I was 7 the last time I didn't need glasses - I never wore contacts. So I have no idea what it was like. It's like brand new to me. I am hoping that  in another few days, it will all go away.

On last thing - the protective goggles they provide you to wear at night for a week will leave deep imprints on your face if you sleep on the side of your face. Practice sleeping on your back. 

Job well done Dr. Violin and Elaine"
672,How does a place with hundreds of millions of dollars of equipment not have working WiFi??? It's 2019!!!
673,"Brietta has been a godsend for my knees. Everyone here is wonderful, but the music here is like being in an elevator! The facility is spacious, not enormous but since I never see more than a few clients in at a time, there's plenty of room. This is a very friendly facility, but that music is killing me! Who works out to instrumental hip hop tracks and ENYA?!? This may seem like a minor thing, but when getting a good sweat on, music does make a big difference! I hope they change Pandora or playlists soon."
674,"Went in on  a Sunday morning..chest pains...yikes

The reception nurses were very calm and friendly, which kept me calm.

I was taken back into the ER and immediately evaluated, it was determined that I needed to be treated at the Seton Medical Center downtown. So away I was transferred.

The ER staff was great, I could not have asked for better people to take care on me."
675,"The most expensive least enjoyable dental experience I have ever had. This office has a husband and wife team. The wife worked on me the first Tim, putting in q post and prepping a tooth for a crown. It was an awful experience (I hate people in my mouth) but she made it bearable. It wasn't $600 worth of bearable for one visit. The next visit I had the husband and he seemed bothered that it took so long to place the crown in my mouth and get a proper fit. That visit was nearly $700. I did not enjoy how they did everything without telling me exactly what was happening. I had to keep asking questions like: ""why are you drilling my tooth into nothing?"" And got responses like ""this is your first time?"" I was thinking ""woman please I am paying you far more than you are worth for some bs service."" Simply put- I will NOT return to this place. I would rather drive 2 hours ones way to a dentist I love and actually cared & won't take my entire savings with them. 

Also the technician in the room held the dryer (for the cement) against my tooth 10 times as long as the doctor has told her too. I worry that between the bleach and other chemicals they sealed my tooth with I was exposed to too much radiation or something. I greatly disliked the way that they did whatever they wanted in my mouth."
676,"More like America's Worst. I stepped out to make a call before my husband went back for his eye exam, they called him back and then refused to let me go back. The girl at the front desk (very petite, wears glasses, brunette, latinx) was extremely rude and told me ""he doesn't need you back there for the exam"". No joke, that is a direct quote and she said it like 'he's not a child'.  I was literally just trying to get the car keys so I could go grab coffee.  Completely blown away by the attitude. I worked in customer service for YEARS and never would I have the balls to be so blatantly rude.

When I asked specifics about the pricing the girl seemed extremely confused and was giving me contradictory information. So rude and bad at her job.

Guy who explained the lens options to my husband for glasses was misquoting us on price and I had to do the math for him so I wasn't over charged. 

Took almost 4 weeks for the contacts to come in, not the 2 weeks promised. Picked up 2 pairs of glasses after 2+ weeks. Same girl behind the desk was rude (waited 15 minutes before she acknowledged us) when we went for pick up. Larger guy (tall and broad) helped do the fitting and was very polite. He was actually the only good part of the whole experience. He made sure the glasses were perfectly fit before he let us go, made small talk, very friendly and well informed about the products. 

Overall, the concept of the store is great. Most of the employees are terrible though. Maybe try a different location."
677,"I visited Hunter Creek ER at the end of April of 2019. I was working a company conference and got sick. On Sunday I went to the ER (incorrectly thinking it was also an urgent care facility) to be seen by a doctor and get some medicine for my throat and cough. The front desk staff (not sure if she is a nurse) was very distant and did not seem at all interested in helping me, if anything she seemed annoyed that I was there at all. The professionalism was extremely low, and I tried to be very polite and explain that wanted to see a doctor for my sore throat and cough. I should've been more discerning during this instant because the quality of care did not improve. She took down some basic information and took my vitals and then took me to a room. I was greeted by the intake person after a few minutes and signed the documents she presented to me. The PA (I don't think he was a doctor) came in and asked what was going on, and I told him. He looked at my throat and my ears, and listened to my heart and lungs. He said my throat was very red but that's about it. He performed no tests. He wrote me a prescription for penicillin and a cough suppressant and then left with no more instructions. The visit with the PA lasted maybe 10 minutes. I waited an additional 10 minutes or more with no one coming. I opened my door and a male staff member asked me to be patient and that he was coming. Keep in mind that I have no instructions from the PA, I have no idea who is supposed to be coming or what the process is. The male staff member says to take the prescriptions and follow the instructions. I check out and am on my way. The entire visit lasted maybe 45-50 minutes and out of that, maybe 30 minutes was in direct contact with a staff member. Out of the four interactions with staff member that I had, the longest was with intake. All the interactions were very unprofessional and all of them seemed very annoyed with me in general. Keep in mind it's a Sunday and they are not at all busy during the afternoon, on this specific day. 

I check my insurance claims a few days later to see that my deductible had been reached. This was shocking because I owed $2k on my deductible to meet it. I check the claims and sure enough I was charged $2800 for this visit. Insurance paid $800 something, so it's $2k something to me for this very insignificant visit. Hunter Creek ER has one line item on the bill, ""Emergency Room Services"". The PA could have done everything he did in the waiting room that he did in the room behind the desk. There were no tests done, at all. I called Hunter Creek to speak about the high bill, because it was so high for such an insignificant visit. I was greeted with a very rude woman. I asked her to review the charges with me and she said there was only one line item, ""Emergency Room Services"", for a total of $2800 something. I asked if that seemed right since my visit was so insignificant and no tests were done. She responded with, ""We can audit the charge if you would like?"". I said, ""Yes"". I received a letter in the mail indicating that my charge was being audited, part of the letter reads as follows; 

""This letter is to confirm your request for a review of your hospital 
charges. It is our policy to audit the entire bill whenever a question arises on a particular item. We have forwarded your audit request to our revenue integrity department who will respond to your directly with the results of the audit, which is usually within 14 days of your request.  

Your account will be reviewed for discrepancies resulting in both overcharges and unbilled items. This means, if items are found that were given, but inadvertently not charged, they will be added to our bill and any overcharges will be take off your bill. Also, you need to understand that both overcharges and unbilled items will be addressed and the appropriate person may be refunded or re-billed. 

Our medical auditors will not address medical necessity for services rendered....""

The letter from the group who did the audit reads as follows; 

""The above account has been reviewed with the medical record for discrepancies results for both overcharges and unbilled charges. The audit does not address medical necessity or the reasonableness of any charge for individual items.""

Basically, both these letters say that they will review the bill and add charges to if if they for some reason weren't billed in the first place and then also remove overcharges. So they say they will remove overcharges but then say they don't consider the reasonableness of the charges in their review, which basically means they won't adjust the cost if something is outrages. 

My bill for $2800 something is not reasonable at all. I had no tests, was seen for under an hour, and only had a sore throat/cough. 

Do not go to this ER."
678,"I wish I could leave ZERO stars for this office, but unfortunately, I must give them at least one.

I took my father to this office because I got a referral from another ophthalmologist. Big mistake.
My dad is self pay because he is visiting me form overseas, so I paid for his procedure in full. I was advised by Dr Jhaveri that once I paid for the consultation and the procedure (which came to over $700), all work done in relation to the procedure, within the next 3 months, would be covered by the cost I had already paid.

I took my dad back in, a couple of weeks later, for a follow up. He got checked and all was good. Then I took him back in again for another follow up and, to my surprise, I was charged $140. When I asked the receptionist why (who was obnoxious, at best), she contacted the person who handles finance and told me it was because my dad had had a certain exam in the first follow up visit he had, and that exam was not covered.

The rest of the staff is friendly and Dr Jhaveri is pleasant and very competent. My issue is that I was never told about the fact that that specific exam was not covered. They assumed it'd be ok and that I would just pay for it out of pocket. And I did, of course. However, it really makes me feel like I was duped, since I was specifically told whatever else we did regarding that procedure would be covered by what I had paid. It makes me feel like they have no respect for their patients' money. They're either poorly trained or purposefully not informing patients of costs so as to trick them into spending more money than they are prepared to.

Dr Jhaveri was apologetic and said they'd refund the money. But, given my experience at the office, I kinda knew they wouldn't. Honesty is not really their forte. As of today (a week and a half after the appointment where all of this went down) the charge is still in my credit card bill. 

If you're a self paid patient, absolutely don't go there. If you're covered by insurance, think twice."
679,"Terrible customer service and rude staff.  Have been here mult times and amazingly it just keeps getting worse. Doctors get you in and out in under 5 min. 

Lost my appointment from this morning and when I showed up the front desk girl (French cdn accent) processed to tell me I did not have an appointment (she was the one who booked me over the phone a week before!!) in front of 8 patients waiting and instead of acknowledging a mistake she called me a liar and I walked out...

Worse medical clinic in Vancouver hands down.

Customer service 1 out of 5
Quality of doctors 1 out of 5"
680,"One of the worst experiences I've ever had. I went in for a Routine cleaning and was bullied into having extra services and they made me swipe my credit card on the spot. They gave me a list of things that I needed to come back for. They also make you pay before you have anything done and came out with an ""estimate"" for what the services would be. The estimates I got was $100 more than what I actually owed and then it was extremely difficult to get the money back even though at the time I paid I was told I would be refunded no problem. I work for the insurance company that I have my dental insurance through so I know for a fact they can get estimates from the insurance company before charging you which they didn't do, they seemed to just pull a number out of thin air. This place is definitely a scam, do not go here. I went for a second opinion after I saw them and was told I didn't need the services they told me I did."
681,"So pleased with this Doctor and his wonderful staff. I think all of us have come across sour medical staff most of the time we step into an office; unfortunately, in spite of the money you are paying, PS office staff are often not the exception either.

Fortunately that was not the case at Dr. Piazza's! From the moment I walked in I was greeted warmly and treated respectfully throughout the entire process. One of his young female assistants was a little hard to read, but I was there to consult about a medical procedure, not make friends so who really cares.

The Doctor was very thorough and spent a LOT of time with me, patiently answering questions and giving me more attention and consideration than my consultations with other Doctors.

If I had concerns, he was able to provide me visible, tangible evidence or email me all kinds of medical journals and studies to read up on. What instilled most of my confidence in him was his intent to give me what I want without allowing the ideal result I imagined to work against me when applied practically. I appreciated that I felt listened to, but looked after at the same time.

Although the other doctors I consulted with had more experience (don't get me wrong, Dr. Piazza still had more than enough experience for me to feel comfortable), I have cancelled my other two consultations and decided to go with him for the procedure because he was by far the most thorough and considerate. 

This is important to me because:

1 - In my experience, the bedside manner of the doctor dictates the quality of handling any complications or questions after the procedure. You should never feel like you have to jump through hoops with your doctor!

2 - Surgery is scary and I want to be seen as a human being! Not just a number. I hate being temporarily out of control under anesthesia so trust is KEY.

Its also worth mentioning that I was fairly pleased once I received the quote for my procedure. In my opinion it wasn't so cheap that I would question his abilities nor so needlessly bloated that I felt taken advantage of. They will be getting a call from me to schedule, soon."
682,"Do not do not come here. Whenever you make an appointment, the staff is just mere rude. I called in to make an appointment with my new physician. Her name is hard to read so I could only tell her first name. The receptionist telling me with an angry voice that she needed a full name. I managed to find the physician full name and told her. I said I wanted to consult about birth control method with my physician. This rude girl asked if wanted a refill on the pills? I said no, i wanted to change to a new method. She asked which one I want to change to???!!!! It's not your problem. U only need to know that I'm changing to a new one and have to consult with the physician! So I said I don't know  yet, I need to talk to her first. She changed her voice telling me that she needs to know and I have to know!!!! What kind of receptionist is this? So if I'm in need of antibiotics but Idk which one treats my infection and I need an appointment. I have to know which one in order to see the doctor? Then who needs doctors then? This isn't the first time it happens. The receptionists and the nurses treat patients carelessly like we're going to a restaurant, not a healthcare clinic. Don't waste your time and money here!!!"
683,"Dr. LoAnn Trinh abandoned me as a patient during a medical crisis in October 2013 - right after i was diagnosed with Stage III Urachal Cancer - and less than two months before i was to get off Medicaid and on to the affordable Care Act - leaving me without a Primary Care Doctor to write my referrals for two harrowing months. Hitting someone when they are down is never appreciated.

When i needed this clinic the most, i received a letter in the mail from them stating that my health conditions were too complex for them to treat, which made absolutely no sense as i only needed this clinic to write referrals. Their letter also suggested i find a new Primary Care Provider on Medicaid, which also made no sense as i was switching to a PPO plan on the Affordable Care Act in two months time, as i am sure many of their other patients were trying to do.

A kind nurse at the Clinic asked Dr. Trinh for a 2-month extension of care for me, and Dr. Trinh refused - without calling me, and without explanation.

BETTER SOLUTIONS

When we are ready for a real solution to America's healthcare problems - the simplest, most compassionate, most cost-effective plan - which every other developed nation except the United States has for these reasons - is: SINGLE PAYER UNIVERSAL HEALTHCARE / MEDICARE FOR ALL"
684,"Edit: stars stay at one. In the end, ONE gal (probably the person who replied to this review) was patient and concerned with how poorly I was treated. She, herself only (sorry I can't remember her name) gets kudos. She got approval to write off the additional x-ray charge and made sure my new bill was sent out. Which I promptly paid...

I will still not return to the location. In the end I found my collar bone WAS actually broken!!!  Great job! 


Original: Should be ZERO stars.. My experience was one of the worst. I was in a snowboarding accident and do not have insurance so I am a cash patient and have limited funds for medical attention. Told them I thought my collarbone was broken. I was told on the phone the visit was $125 on debit or $100 cash. Then if I needed an x-ray it would be $80. So, I made an appointment. Upon arriving I made my cash payment for the visit and the receptionist said I would settle the x-ray when I left, if I needed it. The lady taking them was emotionless and left me standing at the x-ray machine in a vest that I was expected to hold up on my own while she spent what felt like 10 minutes looking at the x-ray before taking me back to the room. The doctor says there are no breaks and sends me on my way with 7 painkillers. I overhear someone saying in the hall that she can't put ""doctor who saw me"" on the prescription, so they used someone else's name. This was very fishy but none of my business because I don't know the protocol. I stop at the front desk and was told unless I needed a doctor's note for work we were all settled up. So I left. 10 days after the accident I talk to an advice nurse who was checking up on me. I tell her I was in alot of pain still. She said she'd call back after she's talked to the doctor. A week goes by and I call back having not heard from anyone. The x-ray tech (I can tell from her lack of emotion) tells me they closed the account. Says I would need to make another appointment. So, I do. I drive there and they turn me away saying all they can do is refer me to get an MRI and can do nothing for me otherwise. 7 weeks later and I get a recorded message calling saying I need to set up an account to pay a bill. Apparently I owe them $160?!? So I call and the gal on the phone (so far the most compassionate of all of them) says I owe that because they took two X-rays because that's what the doctor needed to tell me the bone wasn't broken... I was a cash patient; I should have been told I was being charged for TWO. I should have been informed before taking the x-ray. They had another chance at the front desk after the appointment or even when I came back for a follow up that they turned me away from...... This place doesn't care about you and will rob you blind months afterward..."
685,"I've always struggled with back pain here and there, especially after working multiple 12 hour shifts (Nurse here). But last year I had hit a point of pain that was making work extremely difficult for me. Maybe I just have a low pain tolerance lol, I don't know. But I knew the chiropractor was the way to go, and I had tried a couple more chiropractors before, but they all had these sterile looking doctor's offices, took my vitals, etc just to be of no help. 

I looked again and found this place. At the time, it was just Lisa and her assistant working there. My first visit was a consult, and right off the bat I could tell that Lisa really knew her stuff. She knows the human body like no other. And she was able to pinpoint WHY I've been having back pain. No other chiropractor suggested an xray because my body didn't show the signs of the misalignments I had. This was a huge thing for me. 

She's super personable, I don't usually like people right off the bat, but I love Lisa! Also, as a healthcare professional, it's difficult for me to trust someone twisting my body up, but I swear I trust Lisa 110%, whatever she recommends for my body, I would believe.  And after about a month of consistency, I really didn't notice back pain anymore. Of course, you should stick with the treatment even if you're feeling better though.

Her work is so good, they had to hire a 2nd chiropractor because the client base just wouldn't stop growing. I can't recommend this place enough, and I literally have told all my coworkers and family to go make an appointment ASAP."
686,"I saw Lu after carpal tunnel surgery.  He was great really down to earth and easy to talk
To about what was bothering me.  He was knowledgeable and informative of what was happening and what I needed to do and why. His helper dude Dustin was great support too."
687,"Run from this place as fast as you can. Totally lied to me about a diagnosis in order to get me to pay thousands of dollars. I used a groupon. They wouldn't do my cleaning unless I chose their treatment plan because they said they could lose their dental license. Whatever... I'm going to complain to groupon. They did refund me half of my groupon bc they did the X-rays and exam. They are lying sheisters.  If I could have given zero stars, I would have."
688,"You beats me to review this piece.
I used to be a LOYAL customer. Talking bout, I would coerce my friends and coworkers into getting their optical needs taken care of here. Then, over the years, the service kind of started to... suck.

I mean, one time I was having a glasses EMERGENCY when some assholes (Pearle Vision) broke my glasses during a simple adjustment and I rushed to the only placed I trusted. Although they told me there was nothing that could be done to fix my glasses, which was quite obvious, they offered my a 50% discount on a complete new pair, frames AND lenses! They didn't have to do that. They just felt bad for me and knew I was in a jam. It was super nice and made me fall in love with these people. 

After I got my next pair of glasses which ended up being two pairs of glasses, I started to notice the overall decline in service. One of my pairs of glasses had to have the lenses replaced, twice. The other pair was fine, but every time I went to have them adjusted it seemed as if I was annoying the staff. Uhm, this is part of your job. Stop being a dick about it. The manager most of all was a terrific asshole. I am about due for an eye exam and a new pair of specs and I am definitely not going back to Lenscrafters."
689,"Their extremely poor service caused me real anguish on top of the pain of the wound I came in to get stitches for. I told the receptionist collecting my information that I have a cat bite that is a 1-inch long deep gaping gash that will require stitches. I also told her I need the care provider I will be seeing to know that I have medical trauma and PTSD in medical settings, and that I was currently dealing with panic just being there. She went back and told the Physicians Assistant named Hannah. That gave me hope that there would be *some* accommodations during this appointment. 

Then I waited 15+ minutes experiencing stress and fear and panic that was making me shake and cry and hard to breathe. The receptionist did NOT tell me that their urgent care would NOT be able to administer the stitches that my wound obviously needs. That is crucial information to communicate to a patient who is 1) in pain, 2) knows the wound requires stitches, and 3) has told you that being in medical situations causes panic and PTSD episodes because they have medical trauma. I could have been informed of this and sent to another location at the point of intake, but the receptionist FAILED to convey the limitations of their location and provide the address of another Zoom Care location that could provide the procedure I needed. So fuck her for the unnecessary trauma of my whole experience there.

Sadly, the PA Hannah, who had been personally told by the receptionist there was a patient coming next who has medical trauma and PTSD in medical situations, didn't give a fuck and behaved just like the rest of the self-centered providers in healthcare who give you attitude if you ask for what you need.

As Hannah was leading me to the exam room, I asked if it would be possible for her to tell me everything that is about to happen in the exam room before starting anything. She said of course, I understand, no problem. Then she proceeded to tell me I could sit on the table or in a chair, went to her computer, and started asking me for information, all of which I provided. Then she started putting on nitrile gloves. My panic started rising, so I said ""I am still waiting for you to tell me what is going on here, which you have not done yet."" Hannah replied ""All I did was ask you questions and put in your information, and I need to put on gloves to examine your wound, that's just standard."" CLEARLY she had already started her routine without telling me first what to expect to occur in the exam room before anything got started. So she flat out lied about being willing to make a simple accommodation for a patient with medical trauma. 

Hanna the PA then explained that she needed to see the wound to determine if it needs sutures. I had already told her, as well as the receptionist, that my husband had the same deep gash from our same cat and it required 7 stitches. She said she needed to determine that herself, and that after she examines the wound, she would be rinsing it with saline and prescribing antibiotics, but that this urgent care did not have the capacity to perform the sutures so I would then be referred to another Zoom Care that can. That is how far into the care process I had to endure in order to learn that they could not suture the wound.

I asked why, and Hanna said because they have two appointments booked before they closed and that they were ""squeezing me in."" I said in that case it sounds like I should just go to that other Zoom Care. Hannah replied with attitude ""Well but you came here."" What a bullshit snapback attempt to put me at fault. She then insisted that she needed to do an examination first before sending to me another Zoom location. I said ""Why?"" And Hannah the PA replied ""so that I can determine if sutures are needed."" I said but they are needed, that's why I came to your Urgent Care.

I started standing up, and expressed that I was sorry, and opened the door to hobble down the hall. PA Hannah came out behind me and in a really irritated voice told the receptionist in the hallway ""go ahead and bill this as [something] because she is walking out. Over my shoulder I said ""I thought this was an urgent care."" And she snapped back ""you need an appointment!""

I was too psychologically exhausted after this NON-CARE to withstand another medical visit afterward. They wasted my opportunity to get actual care, and they caused me harm. I went home with no care, no antibiotics, and I will try again tomorrow to interface with the medical industry so that my foot does not become infected. FUCK ZOOM CARE and fuck medical providers for not giving a fuck about anyone but themselves. Avoid this place, and probably all outlets. They zoom right past your needs, but they don't care one bit."
690,"My experiences with Root have been mixed.  I have purchased two Groupons; both for facials, and quite a ways apart.  My first facial was lovely--perhaps the best I have ever had.  The facialist used some kind of paprika peel, which my sweetie thought did actually make me look younger--score!  The place was lovely and serene.  Not cheap, however--I wouldn't be able to pay full price for their services.

This time, I called to book my facial three weeks before the groupon was set to expire, and the receptionist declined to schedule me--saying that all of the groupon slots were full, and that too many people had waited until the last minute, and they were no longer honoring them.  I raised a bit of fuss--this is clearly against Groupon policy--but I knew that the poor receptionist wasn't going to be able to fix this.

So I took up the matter with Groupon, and their customer service has been very responsive and helpful, but as of now, they haven't reached an agreement with Root.  At this point, I have requested a refund.

I find it alarming that the management would so blatantly disregard the policies of the groupon, with so little concern for customer service."
691,"As a Trans woman whose outward gender identity and appearance matches what society says it should be, I don't necessarily feel unsafe most places because I have the privilege of blending in. Unclothed is totally different. Being in a space that has stated policy that says I am safe, that all users have to sign, puts me in a position to be much less guarded than I normally am. I went here tonight for the first time, and while I normally would only feel safe to be topless in a mixed crowd of this type, I felt like I could just be unclothed and not have to deal with the fear I would feel at Sauvie, Bagby or Terwilliger. I will likely become a regular at this place, because aside from that piece of my experience, everything else was also exceptional. Wonderful work on the part of the leadership here to make such a safe, inclusive and warm environment."
692,"My daughter caught a bad stomach virus, and we had to take her to the ER. The staff was very friendly and helpful. They have outlined what is the problem and what they are doing to resolve it. It was a tough night for our us, but thanks to the nurses and the doctor we are back to normal. Thanks you!!!"
693,"Was ready to leave my GYN when she started advertising on Groupon for spa like services.    Felt that an internist would be best for me considering that I had had my children and was getting into the menopausal stages.  
Dr. Grossman entered the room looking nothing like the picture I had seen on her.  She spent quality time with me when I went in for my annual exam.  She answered all of my questions.  I complained that I was VERY tired all the time.  She immediately wanted me to visit a SLEEP CENTER.  I was not too keen on the idea.  She also told me that I needed to lose weight.   I have never been told that by a doctor before.  I am a size 14 ~ and have ALWAYS needed to lose a few pounds.....jumping up and down from 12 - 14.  Had my blood drawn there in the office.  I liked that I did not have to go somewhere else for that.  (Left the doctor's office with directions to lose weight and come back and see me in three months. ) 
Got home to find a survey sent to me on the doctors office.  Wow, quick!  I gave a pretty decent response. Let me just say that I should have waited to respond! 
The next day, I get a call from the nurse telling me that they FORGOT to give me my prescription.  What??  What prescription???   The one for vaginal dryness.  We never spoke of any prescriptions.....only over the counter creams.   Hmmm.  I had her just put it in the mail to me.  When I went to fill it, it was $179/mo. cream.....or $110 with insurance.  WHAT?????   No thank you.  
A few days went by and I called the doctor's office asking for something to help alleviate my tiredness.  I did not have any energy to do anything.  The response I got from Dr. Grossman was that she was not going to prescribe anything UNTIL I visited the sleep center, which by the way did not take my health insurance.  
The dr's office mailed me my blood test ~ which definitely showed that I was indeed menopausal.  When you google menopause, the #1 thing listed is FATIGUE.  Oh my, please help!  Could not get any help from my new doctor.  :(  Fatigue and weight gain are extremely common for menopause.  
Next, I get a bill from the company that took the blood for my annual.  $640   Are you kidding me???   Of course, I received the bill over the weekend and had to wait for Monday morning to call the dr. office to see what is up.  I call, leaving a message.  No return call....I wait till noon and call again. The nurse tells me to call the blood company and ask them what is going on.  Really???   Turns out that I had to call my Insurance company to find out that they would not cover it because the doctor's office had labeled my condition as OBESITY.  OMG!  Really.   I was LIVID.   We ended up doing a three way call back to the doctors office.  Talk about back peddling.  The nurse did that for sure.   The doctor's office did end up changing the label from Obesity to annual exam ~ as they should have.  

Let me just say, I have never had so many headaches from one doctor's visit for an annual exam before.  

I have finally done what I should have done to begin with......ask around for referrals!
Dr. Grossman and her staff are not a good fit for me!"
694,"Had a pretty disappointing run with this clinic. I waited 3 and a half months to see a Dr. When I finally did I I was on time for my appointment but still waited 2.5 hours split between the waiting room and the back room. The Dr. came in and literally looked and my wrist for 30 seconds and asked me maybe two or three questions. Then he left the room. I sat there for another 30 minutes and a nurse came in with a wrist brace? I was rather surprised as I thought the Dr. was coming back to do a proper diagnosis. No. The nurse said ""the Dr. wants you to do some physical therapy and come back in 8 weeks"". I was rather shocked that the Dr. was not coming back as I expected an MRI or something similar to diagnose the problem with my wrist.  The fact that I waited 3 months and then almost 3 hours to see a Dr. who spent no time whatsoever with me simply did not sit well with me. But not much I could do at that point so I left with my wrist brace and physical therapy appointment. The physical therapy did not go much better.  Received very minimal help and was overcharged big-time.  I paid the first overcharge ed bill simply because I did not have the time to argue about it and now received a second bill showing ""whirlpool therapy"" and ""self care management training"" charges however I received no such services. I called and tried to get the bill adjusted to no avail. I waasted another 30 minutes and got nowhere.  Now the worse thing is the collection department has my cell phone number and they call literally every two days with an autodialer telling me that I ""need to check the online portal and that I have a balance due. I have never used the ""portal"" and I think the fact that they use an autodialer to pester you about a bogus bill is simply absurd. Really... they are going to use an autodialer to bug you every two days?
 I would not recommend these fools to my worse enemy. Now 6 months later I am looking for a new orthopedic doctor because I received no help whatsoever from Peachtree Orthopedic Clinic and my time was severely wasted."
695,This was one was a horrible. I took my brother the the er on 30th of June for what appeared to be strokes. Covid 19. can go in wait 3hrs. Sent hm with no order and unknown problem. Ok 3th of July took him back for the same thing. This I had to stay in the ER room with him due to one doctor two nurses. Did not provide any protection for me after 3 hours I left due to concern for my self. We will never use this hospital again. His heart doctor also belong to this group. Make me wonder about his doctors there.
696,"I can't believe I waited to so long to finally have my Lasik surgery done. Throughout the years, I thought about doing it but I let my fears get the best of me. Dr. Eugene Smith and his staff are truly amazing. The surgery only lasts 15 minutes and through it all I didn't experience any pain. When preparing for the lasik surgery,  there will be minor pressure applied to each eye to hold it in place but that was the worst part. The pressure lasts 30 seconds and I appreciated the doctor counting down to relieve any fears I had. Within minutes of the surgery I could tell my vision drastically changed for the better. My procedure was completed by 8am on 3/29/18. From 8:30 am-11:15am I slept because it is best to rest your eyes as your eyes are going to feel aggravated but after that I was completely fine. I even attended a business lunch at a restaurant at noon and my eyes didn't water or itch at all. Upon my follow up check up,  I was told I now have 20/15 !!!!! As a mom of 2 small children that are used to constantly breaking my glasses, hurting the bridge of my nose with daily headbuts..  I couldn't be happier with my results. Thank you so much Dr. Eugene and staff for changing my life!!!!"
697,"Most ridiculous office of any kind I've been to in all my days. First off, they present well with a nice office and complimentary drinks with a fruit if you'd like...but it's all downhill from there.

Not one employee, including the dentist owns English as their first language. That may be a plus for many people as it shows the possibility of a higher learning for them but when their accents are so thick that you can't understand what they are explaining about your treatment and what you ""need"" done, it makes the consultation very difficult and uncomfortable...especially when they keep trying to ask you about things that have nothing to do with your treatment in order to divert your attention to their ridiculous costs.

So for me, apparently my insurance did not pay for their cleaning services so they offered me a $97 cleaning with x-rays and a take-home whitening kit...this is extremely high-priced as you will find most dental offices offer $27-$57 first time visit cleanings with x-rays. However, this story gets much more crazy. I went ahead with the $97 offer since my schedule is tight and I was already there plus I had already spent a lot of time filling out their first-time visit paperwork (with a ton of unnecessary personal questions) and emailed them my latest x-rays as they requested. I also work in radiology and requested that the panoramic x-rays not be taken as they are higher radiation dose than you might think and you really only need that x-ray taken once every five years. They tried explaining to me how I need the x-ray done again and how it is very little radiation to which I had to respond to them the actual radiation dosage of which a panoramic x-ray consists. They obviously are not educated in the field to which they expose their patients and patients' children. Worst yet, they don't even own a thyroid shield to protect their patients thyroid gland which is the highest exposure risk in a panoramic x-ray! No wonder there is a rise in thyroid cancer today!

Ok, so furthermore on the visit...after finally understanding their pitch of diverting conversations about things irrelevant to the exam and through their accents of what I ""needed"" for dental treatment, they REFUSED to give me the cleaning that I originally paid the $97 for unless I got a deep cleaning with them that would cost me over A THOUSAND DOLLARS AFTER my insurance coverage! That is completely outrageous since I was given one of these just three years ago from my last dentist (who unfortunately moved out of state) and only charged a few hundred with the same exact insurance coverage! They were also very emphatic about not giving me the cleaning I already paid for unless I paid them the $1,100 for the deep cleaning! On top of that, they never gave me the whitening kit that was supposed to be included in the high-priced initial visit fee!

If you want a pleasant waiting area and strangers trying to act like your friend (so you won't think about the business aspect of your treatment) this place is for you....but as far as dental care vs ethics and cost, this is the worse dental office in the history of the world."

They will tell you that you need more than what you need and they charge far higher for services than other offices. They will also go as far as lying to you about it when asked about each procedure as well as lying about things they don't truly understand like the radiation exposure you receive from a panoramic X-ray. Yes, I've had these experiences here.

699,"This places was terrible, Marge the owner was terrible... If I could give zero stars I would.. not friendly and unfortunately untrustworthy as well. I am posting a pic of my release letter just to show the exact wording used by my own PT Marge. But first I wanna say i built up some strength but at a cost the last few weeks I think we increased the weight too much, I did hurt something in my left hand it's been that way after the first noticeable weight increase. Also a new shoulder injury with pain during rotation. Still exists now. 

My main concern was the letter and what she said. Since I'm on a workers comp claim, I was injured at work. All my appointment are mandatory obviously and so is any PT, or any other hoop they ask you to do. Which I gladly do. But what she said clearly puts my entire livelihood at risk since I'm the major breadwinner at my home.. this lady Marge, 
Clearly stating that I had ""4"" NO SHOWS. In the next sentence she says that I had rescheduled that same day. I did give her notice and even rescheduled for later in the same day.. 2 were cause of doc visits at the same time so I rescheduled my PT obviously.. and the supposed ""4th"" no show I was there.. and the front door was locked... during business hrs.. so I'm not even sure why she wrote that and I was not going to go back and ask just to have a conflict.. 
and clearly writes that I purchased a kayak and have gone kayaking several times.... are you fucking kidding me..... 

I hope some upper management can see and review this.. 


if you look at the address you can see this is the new Gladstone location. While I was there for over 3 months I only seen 3 other people.. and on a side note every time I came to my appointment the doors were always locked. Even midday, It's no wonder I only seen 3 other people."

701,"I recently had surgery here on June 6, 2017- a total ankle surgery. I will start with the positives
1) The pre-op nurse who took me back to surgery was efficient.
2) The nursing assistant who took care of me the first day I was in my room was kind compassionate and caring. She made sure I was comfortable and checked on my every hour. 
3) The food wasn't bad. 
And now for the downsides ...
1) NO ONE contacted me prior to surgery regarding me how much I was going to have to pay. The business office now insists that they called me and left me messages regarding how much I was going to owe them prior to this surgery. But, as I look back to my calls (and like everyone I have a smart phone so this is easy, reliable and accountable) I have two missed calls from a number I did not recognize on the day they said they called me, but NO MESSAGES to explain the nature of the call. Trust me when I say, if someone left a message telling me I would owe over $4000 for this surgery, I would have called back asap. But NO MESSAGE ( and once again, my smartphone keeps a record of this, not matter what the girl in the billing office says). But,  the billing office insists that messages were left. No. They were not. And so, at 5 am the morning of my surgery, I was told I owed over $4000 to ARISE - this was completely out of left field and was not accurate. My insurers made a mistake on my out of pocket expenses. But I could not have this surgery unless I gave them a credit card to ensure payment. I was livid, as one can imagine.  Now- I am stuck in limbo with fighting with my insurers and Arise about this amount. 
2) After my surgery, I was awoken to a nurse freaking out over me because I was in an Afib situation and telling me I was going to be transferred to St. David's hospital. This nurse caused me to have undue stress at the time of my waking. Of course, I was disorientated and could not process all the questions she was asking me - the only one I can remember -did I have a heart problem? For the record, I have no underlying heart issues. I am not overweight, I am a long distance swimmer; I do not have hypertension or diabetes or anything that would be the source of this. In fact, I was in a stressful situation ( just having had major surgery) and her reactions around me did not help. Once the anesthesiologist confirmed I was ok, I was sent to my room. But this reaction on the part of this nurse was unprofessional at best. 
3) Once in my room, I spend the first 24 hours not moving (per my doctor's orders). Then, then next day, I needed to get up, use my crutches, and go to the bathroom before I could be released to go home. NO ONE from PT came to help me or show me how to get up and use my crutches or assist me in walking or showing me how to navigate. And the nurse I had on duty, Andrea Moretz, did not know how to help me. I was never given a bed bath (I asked- twice). I basically got up on my own without any help on her part (She did stand there and watch!). Nor was I offered any assistance to the toilet.  I had to lower myself down with the aid of a walker and the grab bar next to the toilet.  My care the day after the surgery was without compassion, barely efficient and extremely risky. When I inquired about PT coming to help me, I was told my doctor did not order a PT script. This is not true. He did. What orthopedist who performs joint replacement does not have PT come assist their patients? Arise wants to put blame on him. Well, it's ridiculous. I was at risk for a fall and they just did not seem to care.
4) And the bill for 32- hour stay in this hospital came to a whopping $115,000. Hence the fact they wanted $4700 upfront, the 30% remaining of my out of pocket. I had not seen a bill because it was an estimate and as I mentioned...no one bothered to leave me a message or call me back to discuss this. I have had multiple orthopedic surgeries and have NEVER seen a bill this high. I am horrified they get away with charging this much. 

With the exception of the before care surgery nurse and the nursing assistant I had my first day, this was - BY FAR- the worst hospital experience I have ever had, and, because of a car wreck I had 20 years ago, I have had many orthopedic procedures performed. I know what hospital stays are meant to be like. If you are told that you are being sent here, don't go. Pick another place. You have the right to do so."
702,"An ambulance took my 77 year old father, a Vietnam War veteran, to St Davids South from the St David's ER in Bastrop.  I saw that St David's South is a level 2 trauma center so I was initially relieved he was going here.  That was short lived.   My dad was being admitted for a severe intestinal infection, organ failure, severe dehydration, fever, and signs of septic shock.  He was on antibiotics and IV fluids from the ER.  The ER already had a room reserved at the hospital when the ambulance left.

On arrival to the hospital he was put in his room with no IV fluid or meds of any kind for an hour and a half before a doctor ever came into his room!  Unbelievable!  On top of this, the floor nurse stopped us to have an argument with the ambulance team on the way in!  Way to go patient care.  The room nurses could do nothing until a doctor arrived.  At this point he had rigors and signs of septic shock.  I escalated everything to the head floor nurse who told me that the hospital is just very busy because of everyone moving to Austin and that the hospital is building more rooms.  Im sorry but that is not acceptable!  Especially for a level 2 trauma center!  

Once doctors were involved I have to say care was very good.  That is the only reason this is getting two stars!  Your PA, Neals, is an asset and was great to have involved!  He escalated care and acted fast to stabilize my father.  

So if you can survive for almost two hours in your patient room without dying this may be a good hospital!  I served as a combat medic in the US Army.  I not only served in the field and with mass casualty but also in an ER.  I have to say your inpatient triage process sucks!  On top of this you had a broken computer in the room so doctors and nurses had to go out in the hallway to bring in mobile ones for patient care.  This just delays care.  You also had exposed electrical outlets in the room with broken covers.  And here's the thing, thats a small item but I have to think if a hospital can't fix broken outlets and computers what else are they neglecting?  Is it sad when hotels maintain their hotel rooms better than St Davids South maintains their patient rooms?  I'm disappointed.  Shouldn't your operations and services also live up to a level 2 trauma center?  

Lastly, my fathers medical is covered 100% through the VA.  He is a war veteran who almost died in the hospital.  Yet the billing department is now sending us bills as uninsured!  You're kinda violating a federal mandate.  I understand you outsource your billing but it still directly reflects back on your facility.  It's my understanding from the VA in Austin that this is a pattern with how veterans who come to your facility get treated.  

To all of the room nurses, doctors, Neals, and the surgeon I say thank you from the bottom of my heart!  You are doing a great job!  My dad is still here because of you!  Your hospital needs to do a better job in supporting you!"
703,"DO NOT GO TO CASTLE DENTAL!!!!
It was the most horrifying experience I've ever had!!! 
I like most people dislike the dentist, but I needed to go! I was new to the area I looked into castle dental probably because of the convenient locations (that's the only thing ""convenient"" about them)
Long story short. I went, the exam was descent, I scheduled an appointment next day for two fillings. First one went by easy! Second one comes along and he reaches the nerve! The dentist tells me ""you have to get a pulpotomy or have it pulled"" well I wasn't going to start yanking teeth out so I said ""save it""
Pulpotomy it was! He started digging the top part of my nerve out! I busted out into tears...he said ""10 more seconds"" he might as well have ripped my tooth out...the numbing they do to fill a cavity...is one thing but expecting it to work at all for a pulpotomy??? Not at all! Thats like putting a bandaid on a shark bite (& I mean an aggressive out of this world shark bite) & expecting it to be all better! Then when he was all done he sent me on my way. For four days (april6-april9)I was in pain. I stayed in bed and took as much ibuprofen that was allowed in a day! Come Monday morning I couldn't take it any longer. I called and talked to the dr. He said he didnt understand why I was hurting. He seemed clueless! Then out of no where said ""I know what it was. I must of hit a nerve wrong"" he told me to come in and he'd look at it. I went in...he looked at it & said ""nothing is wrong let me give you a pain block (injection)"" I refused! ""The hell you are going to put another needle in my mouth!"" I thought to myself! I of course needed to get to a endodontist for a root canal & refused castle dentals referral to one of their own. I found the most amazing one! I had it done April 11th. After that horrible experience at castle dental, & having a root canal done by an AMAZING Doctor (not remotely associated with castle dental) I'm glad to say I'm better!  CASTLE DENTAL= unprofessional"
704,"Let me preface this with the fact that I'm in the medical field AND I've had yearly exams for the last 30 years. 

I had an appointment yesterday afternoon. Usual procedures ran smoothly, reception and staff were very friendly, wait time was not terrible at all. (Covid recommendations were observed and painless).

Then Dr. Nguyen called me into his office. I'm a generally friendly person, but he did not seem receptive to it, figured he was all business, fine. I came in my scrubs after work (in an office building). He asked if I was around covid patients all day and I said I wasn't, his relief was palpable. I can't help but think, though, that he already labeled me as someone he didn't want to spend one more minute than possible with. (I get it's scary to see us in public, but I had a mask on, had washed my hands before going into his office and did the screen and temp at check in)
Before even checking my eyes he basically told me to give up and accept that I was going to need bifocals because I'm now in my 40's. Um, ok? Thanks?
He checked my vision with the slides. ALWAYS in the past ANY doctor knows 1 & 2 need to be repeated. 3 & 4 need to be repeated. Better 1? Better 2? Nope. He sighed repeatedly when I asked to go back to 1 again. Finally I just hoped I was right the first time.
Then he looked at my retina and told me I had scarring. Huh? That sounds traumatic. I did not have any reason to make this particular appointment other than I needed new boxes of contacts. He did not explain much other than I did something really bad and I must be sleeping in my contacts. I was emphatic about not doing that because I learned my lesson YEARS ago how bad it was for me personally from an AMERICA'S BEST DOCTOR! 
After that he was very condescending, telling me how I have to use drops in my eyes for a week before he would give me my prescription. I absolutely understand that - again, I'm in the medical field. But his manner, his tone and general impatience was so upsetting to me. I've never as a patient felt like that leaving any office.

The person helping me was absolutely wonderful. They said that they had been here for a short time but I wasn't the first complaint they heard about this doctor, and gave me the national line to call and report him.

Stars are for staff and adhering to great covid guidelines."
705,"Dr. Gilcrease has been the primary physician for myself and my family for over 14 years.  He is a wonderful Doctor.  My issue is not with the Doctor, it is with his horrible, unprofessional staff.  WOW.  They are terrible.   

The saddest part is, Dr. Gilcrease is completely unaware of it.  In November of 2014, my husband had the misfortune of meeting Miranda, the Doctor's front office check-in person.  She badgered him in front of other patients in the waiting room over a $28 dollar delinquent charge from a statement back in January of this year.  My entire family has been seeing Dr. Gilcrease for over 14 years and we have never been late on a payment, or been delinquent in any fashion.  When my husband had the nerve to question the $28 charge and it's validity, little miss rude, I mean Miranda, told him to ""have a seat sir, we'll have to see whether or not we can work this out.""  In other words, SHE was going to decide if he should see the Doctor or not, over $28 dollars!!!  Wow.  She's on a huge power trip.

Miranda finally decided she would let him see the Doctor, provided he sign a form consenting to a lawsuit if he doesn't pay the $28.00.  He was mortified.  When he made it into the back area, he told the vitals nurse what happened.  She seemed unaffected, and said she tries not to talk to the girls up front too much.  She also acknowledged that they get ""a lot of complaints about those girls.""

When I personally called the office to complain, Miranda was rude, a liar, refused to patch me through to Dr. Gilcrease, made excuses about being new, told me it's not her fault, blamed my husband, blamed the billing department.....I could go on for an hour about our unpleasant conversation.

She finally (reluctantly) put me through to the office manager, who is kind but clueless.  He also refused to put me in touch with Dr. Gilcrease directly, obviously protecting his incompetent staff.  My last resort is to let Dr. Gilcrease know what is going on while he is not looking vis this poor review.  I will be shopping for another doctor because I can't stand the thought of going back there and listening to Miranda at the front desk belittle me or my family while she text's on her phone and chomps on her gum.  So very sad."
706,"Wow!!!if I could give this place ten stars I would !!!i went in today for my first time with Botox ever!! The minute I walked in I felt such a positive and friendly vibe and was so relieved. Jessica and Becky greeted me at the door. They were both so welcoming and I could tell right away I made the best choice to be here. Becky was going to do my Botox and she could tell I was nervous. She asked Jessica to come hang with us while she worked.  We all chatted like girls at coffee and it was so relaxed. These women are beautiful inside and out. The best part of the whole deal is the needles didn't even hurt. Seriously. If this is holding u back don't let it. It's tiny tiny pricks.   I have worked at high end salons and dealt with the egotistical individuals who don't care about u as a person. This place is down to earth,real, kind and did an AMAZING job on my Botox. Zero bruising and mosquitos have given me bigger marks than this. Love yourself enough to go see Becky or Jessica. They are wonderful. Thank you ladies for being you !!!i will be back!!!!"
707,"This place feels almost like visiting a spa instead of a doctors office.  The staff is so friendly and they actually acknowledge you when you are at the front desk.  It drives me crazy when receptionists won't even look at you at a doctor's office.   The office is also very nice, clean and relaxing. 
I had my appointment today and Dr Dai's Clinic runs on time which is nice.  It's nice to not have to wait 30 minutes to get called back and then sit another 30 minutes in a room before seeing the doctor.  They run like a well oiled machine.  All of the back office staff was super nice too (which helps when having drops and lights in your eyes).   
I can't imagine ever going to an optometrist or another eye doctor."
708,"First of all, let me start off by saying that I have no anxiety when it comes to the dentist/dental work - however, I can now understand why people do.  

The only pleasant part of my experience was due to the friendliness of the receptionist.  She was always very helpful and personable. 

The Dr. was not only rough with my teeth and gums, but he was extremely rude to his assistant and that made me very uncomfortable.  He snapped at her numerous times, and even forcibly took the suction tool out of her hand (knocking it against my teeth as well) when she was not performing the task to his standards. I could not believe it.

I have had cavities filled in the past and have never been put through so much pain and discomfort. The Dr. did not take my own personal pain threshold into consideration - he just wanted to get the job done.  I had to stop him multiple times to tell him that I was in serious amounts of pain, and he would respond by acting very annoyed about having to inject more medicine into my gums.  When I had to stop him because of the seriousness of the pain for the 5th time, he got very irked and told me that it was because I was so nervous that my heart was beating too fast, and therefore was pumping the numbing meds through my body to fast.  He told me that if I would just calm down, then I would not be in so much pain. He then continued on with the procedure without adding anymore of the numbing meds - and I laid there in extreme pain for the next hour of the procedure.  This was more than 24hrs ago, and I can still not open my mouth wide enough to eat solid food - the pain in my jaw has not subsided at all.  This is not normal for having cavities filled. 

On an even more personal note - he was extremely touchy.  He rubbed my shoulders, legs, and arms (while telling me that I was ""doing great"" throughout the procedure) without my consent on multiple occasions.  Would he have done the same to a man? Or is all that touching just reserved for young women?  

On my first visit, after my check-up was finished, I mentioned that a section of my gums hurt where a piercing had previously been and asked if he had seen any damage during the examination. He then lifted my lip and touched my gums WITHOUT having gloves on.  I was so taken aback by this that I jumped back away from his hand - but he put his ungloved finger in my mouth anyway. 

The whole experience was also very messy.  I had water running down the back of my neck almost the entire time - when I left, the back of my shirt around my neck was soaked with water.  There was also small splotches of blood on my shoulder from it spraying out of my mouth.  When my teeth were being cleaned, the polish was spraying on my chin, cheeks, and neck the entire time.  

I apologize if this review is a bit scattered - it is hard to put into words the depth of the awfulness of my experiences with Austin Dental Works (again, this does not include the receptionist)."
709,"After writing this review the manager of the Centra Care contacted me and asked that I come back in free of charge to have my eye re-checked. If I had to base my experience with her I'd be leaving a 5-Star rating. She was excellent at addressing my concerns, making me feel cared for and was very understanding. 

However, upon my arrival at the clinic, it was clear that the staff had been given a dressing-down for my complaint. The nurses were terse with me, bordering on angry. When the doctor came in to see me, he actually went as far as to bring up my review and list his points for rebuttal as he was examining my eye. Now, I understand the he felt like he needed to respond in defense of his actions. I mean, my review, while true, wasn't very nice, but he did not need to do it while I was being examined, vulnerable and exposed. I felt VERY uncomfortable. He gave me another prescription for a different kind of antibiotic and told me there was nothing else he could do if this didn't work. Essentially, saying that he never wanted to see me again. Again, not very comforting that the man who clearly is enraged by me is halfheartedly handing me a prescription and telling me to not come back. I'm sure not all employees and staff at every Centra Care are this way, but for me in this time of need, it was a disappointment, therefore, they rate a 3 star update."
710,Very disappointed with the service at this dental office. I decided to come in because I moved and my previous dentist is completely out of the way. Felt welcome at first as the environment seemed relaxing enough but as I was getting my spec exam it seemed as though there was tension between the dentist (dr.yee) and assistant. Perhaps she was new to the job but either way it was very uncomfortable. Dentist was pushy and rude which made my experience very unpleasant. Not sure if I will be returning or not.
711,"My cataract surgery with Dr. Hamilton was a total success! You may think, well, cataract surgery is very routine, so why are you so excited about that? Mine was anything but routine, since it involved removing a previous lens implant, and exchanging it for a new lens implant. I was referred to him by another ophthalmologist, who declined to do it himself, as it was not his area of expertise, but who told me that implanted lens removal and replacement was something that Dr. Hamilton, who had extensive experience with this procedure, could perform well.

Why would I need an implanted lens exchange? It's a long story, but the issue related to my ten year adaptation, and satisfaction with, ""monovision"" (one eye used for far vision, the other for near vision), but a real need for cataract surgery.  The monovision had been working well by using a contact lens in my right eye for correcting myopia, so I could see at a distance, and no correction in my left eye (since I was also myopic in that eye, it was great for near vision). When diagnosed with cataracts in both eyes, I wanted the new lens implants to match what I had experienced with monovision, so that glasses for either reading or distance would be unnecessary.

I informed a previous ophthalmologist (not the one who referred me to Dr. Hamilton, but another ophthalmologist), of my desire for monovision to be maintained after the needed cataract surgery. This other ophthalmologist performed cataract surgery in my left eye, my non-dominant eye, which was the eye I had been using for near vision for over 10 years. My right, dominant, eye only had been used for far vision over the same time period. 

Unfortunately, the lens implant done by this previous ophthalmologist was not for near vision, but for something in between near and far vision. The bottom line was that I could not read comfortably (without squinting and holding the reading material far away, which is hard because I'm a short person with very short arms). Now, I had to use my right, dominant eye, for reading, since the lens implant was only in my left eye, and use my left eye, with the new lens implant, for far vision. Since I had been successfully adapted to monovision using the opposite eyes for over 10 years, this was also very uncomfortable. In addition, the left eye was not fully corrected for far vision (somewhere in between near and far vision), so it was not safe to use for driving, etc., although that's what I was trying to do to adapt to the situation, at least on a temporary basis. 

The solutions offered by the previous ophthalmologist who performed cataract surgery in my left eye were to (1) do a lens implant in the right eye for near vision (so at least one eye would be good for near vision, even though it would be the dominant eye, which is not the best practice for near vision), and use a contact lens to see at a distance with the left eye. This solution would be the opposite of what I had been adapted to for over 10 years, and would required ongoing external correction (contact lens); (2) A second option was to reverse this, and do a far vision implant in the right eye, and add a ""piggyback"" implanted lens in the left eye, to enable near vision in the left eye, and far vision in the right eye. This solution would at least be compatible with my 10 years of visual adaption to monovision; (3) I was told that removing the implanted lens from the left eye, and replacing it with one which allowed for near vision, was not an option, although this seemed like the best solution to me.

That's when I went to see Dr. Hamilton for a second opinion, who successfully removed the previously implanted lens in the left eye, and exchanged it for a lens that provided near vision, allowing for comfortable reading. Based on my great experience with Dr. Hamilton, I have already scheduled cataract surgery for my right eye for far vision, and am completely confident that he'll do it right (the first time)!"
712,"I had a TERRIBLE experience at Medspring. 

After getting a cold sore in my nose, my eye had begun to burn and water severely. I wanted to make sure the virus hadn't spread to my eye. The eye in question looked normal but the burning and stinging had gotten progressively worse throughout the day. I wanted to take the proper precautions and catch any infection early so I went to Medspring since my regular doctor was closed. 

The receptionist was nice enough. Within a few minutes of arriving, I was led into a room, and the doctor came in less than 10 minutes later. Then things started to go downhill. I explained my situation to the doctor; he looked at the cold sore in my nose and then at my eye. Then he said, ""Well your eye looks completely normal,"" and stared at me blankly. I told him I understood this, but that it was really burning badly and very uncomfortable. He told me he wasn't an eye doctor and there was nothing he could do: ""All I can tell you is what I see, and I don't see anything."" Silence again. I continued to ask him questions, and he kept giving me the same response: ""I'm not an eye doctor so I can't really tell you one way or another."" That extremely helpful and detailed advice cost me $100. I get that Medspring doctors are general practitioners, but I was talking about COLD SORES. One of the most common viruses EVER. Granted, he did prescribe me a refill for Valtrex after lamely telling me again there was nothing he could do. 

Next time, I'll stick with WebMD until my doctor's office opens on Monday."
713,"I went there for a botox between my eyebrows. Dr. Mark Goldsmith doesn't look like he knows what he's doing. He got the instruction sheet he kept lookingback and forth on it and injecting. It was very painful & lots of blood came out from the injection sites and it took him 45min. I have had botox before somewhere else, all it took was 5 min. Dr. Goldsmith was very unprofessional and doesn't know what he's doing and his hand was shaking during the procedure. I was very uncomfortable. I would definitely NOT recommend!!"
714,"My husband and I met Dr. Rob at a Newton business fair last fall. We thought he was a little weird then, just kept talking at us and not to us, but we shrugged it off. 

 In Dec 2010 I finally made and appointment because I've been experiencing a lot of back pain. 

My husband and I arrived at the office and as it was Christmas were greeted by holiday decorations and a big flatscreen TV showing Bible quotes and quotes about how chiropractic is better than surgery etc. To say the video was poorly made, is putting it mildly. The video just kept playing the same slides with this awful font that I found imposing and somewhat hostile. 

Not to mention that I think having so much religious propoganda in a public business, a doctors office no less, is incredibly inappropriate.

My husband asked if I wanted to leave, but we decided to continue on anyway since I was there and it's not easy for me to take time off during the day--something Dr. Rob continuously seemed to ignore whenever we tried to schedule appointments.

So my first appointment began and it was awkward. Dr. Rob threw out a whole bunch of mumbo-jumbo and talked at us. He took x-rays, felt my spine etc, and then after an hour or so said we were done as he needed to look at the x-rays and we needed to schedule another appointment. 

I was annoyed as he led me to believe we'd be doing some actual work towards relieving my pain.

Anyway, my husband ended up the same day getting an appointment at another Chiropractor's office and we decided to compare experiences. His was MUCH better. So I canceled my next appointment with Allasso and requested that they forward all of my medical records and x-rays to this other office.

A few days later Dr. Rob called my husband asking why I was not going to come back and he explained that the video made me very uncomfortable. Dr. Rob then admitted he had gotten complaints about it before and then asked if my husband was going to be canceling his appointment as well. He said yes, and then Dr. Rob immediately told him he needed a credit card # to pay some balance that our insurance wouldn't cover because it didn't meet the deductible. It sounded very strange so we called our insurance and they said that a claim had never been submitted.

I explained to Dr. Rob that he needed to send me a formal invoice and needed to submit the information to my insurance regardless of whether or not they cover it. 

He emailed me an invoice. I requested a mailed hardcopy, which I never received.

Finally about 2 weeks ago I got a claims summary from my insurance and they are covering the majority of the balance that Dr. Rob wanted me to pay by credit card.


I still haven't received my medical records or the x-rays."
715,"I will never be returning!!! The front desk is very nice, Jasmine. The doctor never got to know me as a patient. I can't remember his name and he isn't in any of the pictures. He never asked how I felt and why. He said we need to treat you 2x a week because your spine isn't good. Showing me what a spine looks like.  He also never asked what I wanted. Just said things to me. It was very clear, that his job is to get sell a package of appointments, following the company guidlines. Like a monthly subscription. I think The Joint is a very shitty place to get any wellness treatment. You talk about wellness everywhere but only offer Adjustments without preparation. Which is very uncomfortable. That coupled with your horrendous business model, I will never return. All you have here is a turn and burn operation. You are the McDonalds of Chiropractics! Dont get your adjustment at McDonalds."
716,"Aspen Dental of Natick is a total scam! Please read this and other Yelp reviews before they rip you off too! 
    At my 1st appointment the hygienist checked my gums for pockets and refused to clean my teeth. She aggressively pressured me to get a deep scaling and purchase costly oral hygiene products. I told her I had good oral health six months earlier with my previous dentist. She began badmouthing my prior hygienist's work and said my gums were rampant with bacteria and that I had severe bone loss. 
    I told her I just wanted a regular cleaning that was covered by my new insurance but the hygienist insisted that would spread bacteria and was against ADA guidelines. I was naive and assumed the hygienist was honest and ethical. I let fear take over and scheduled a longer appointment. 
    Then the hygienist ushered me to the business manager who quoted me $1,438 at which I baulked (as I usually paid $105 for routine cleanings.) I inquired about my insurance and was told scaling wasn't covered but they'd give me a ""discount"" to bring it down to $880 and then they set me up on a payment plan. 
    Well, I had the deep scaling procedure. Then I returned a few months later for a routine cleaning and the hygienist again refused to do it and she used the same aggressive sales tactics. When I objected, she humiliated me by raising her voice within earshot of other patients and staff stating I had bacteria and gum disease and needed another deep scaling. I suspected I had been duped and told her she made me very uncomfortable. I left without being treated and Aspen Dental never contacted me after that. 
 I recently returned to my original dentist and they confirmed the scaling Aspen did was unnecessary and that my gums are healthy! I suspected this all along that Aspen's hygienist lied! I feel so gullible, fleeced and outraged. After reading these other yelp reviews, I've learned that Aspen Dental of Natick is conning other innocent people into unwarranted and over-priced dental procedures while giving the dental profession a terrible reputation. I want to warn everyone to stay away from Aspen Dental!"
717,I recently came in to have a routine checkup. What really bothered me is how inept the x ray technician was. She took over 20 minutes to take my x rays and the entire time was confused and wasn't sure what she was doing. She kept shouting for a fellow coworker to come by and show her how to use the equipment. Maybe I'm being paranoid but it bothered me how many x rays she ended up taking and I was subjected to. The entire time she was doing this she failed to place the bitewing in my mouth correctly so it was very uncomfortable. All the while she kept telling me how annoyed she was and sighing. The dentist was friendly enough but I did feel like I was being pressured to buy things. Like a used car salesman. The dental hygenist was a little rough with me but I don't really have any complaints because that comes with the cleaning I guess. Overall I won't be coming back. I think I got enough radiation for a lifetime.
718,"I had Sclerotherapy this past May done on my legs for 15 minutes. I'm 36 and they got worse the last 4 years. I didn't like to wear shorts. They look amazing now! I have just a couple of them left that are noticeable in the worst area. I will be going back again in the fall to get some finishing touches. In terms of pain. If you've ever had acupuncture it's like that. Very light prick. The worst part was wearing the stockings. I'm not a fan. Very uncomfortable. I couldn't wait to take them off every night. But that's only for 7 days. I do recommend this place. The Dr. and nurses, down to the receptionist are professional and friendly."
719,"I have to agree with another review of this place charging WAY too much and only going there if a child is critically ill.  

I had to take both my sons there because they were too young to go to another hospital.  The first visit we were at the ER and they wanted to keep my son for observation.  The ER was great.  The problems started when we got upstairs.  Everytime the monitor beeped no one bothered to come in.  I actually had to ask if anyone was going to come in or tell me how to shut it off so my son could sleep.  They tried to give us expired formula.  The room is horrendous for parents who have to stay with infants very uncomfortable.  The shower was cold. 

Now the medical part.  We told the doctors that our son quits breathing normally.  They hooked him up to monitors the first night.  The next day they said he was fine.  I told them he didn't eat much because he was tired.  If he were to breath abnormally it would be the second night.  The doctor refused to use the monitor again.  They also wanted to test him for reflux.  We were told if we stayed another night they could get him in the next day.  Otherwise, they didn't know when they could get him in.  So we stayed another day.  It was a sleeping room that night.  No one came in all we did was sleep there.  He was supposed to be scheduled first thing in the morning.  Then they told us 10 AM.  Then they came in to tell us to feed him because it would be that afternoon.  We found out they were taking in non-emergency cases while we sit in our room waiting!  They finally did get him in late that afternoon.  After that we were told we could leave.  Well no one came in and I knew that at 6 pm they make there final rounds.  It was almost 6 pm when I had to ask if someone was coming in.  They told us we couldn't leave because the doctor who was supposed to read the EKG report that day didn't read the report and they didn't want to release us. My husband and I are normally patient and do not cause a big stir, but we both had enough at this point.  My husband told them we were leaving regardless if that report was read or not.  The rounds doctor came in to convince us to stay, but we were firm on leaving.  We left, but found out the next day.  They didn't do the EKG right.  We had to go to St. David's to have it done because we refused to step back in to Dell.  


When my second son was born, he ran a 102 fever.  Our doctor insisted he go to Dell.  Both my husband and I gritted our teeth and took him to Dell.  We got to the ER and once again they were very nice and quick.  We fought them about keeping our son for observation due to our experience last time.  The doctor insisted that we stay in case it was meningitus.   He said 1 night would be enough to tell and they could start antibiotics.  My husband hated that place so bad he was refusing to stay.  The ER doctor ended up calling our pediatrician to convince us to stay.  So, I stayed with my son in the hospital.  When I got upstairs they said it would be 2 -3 days.  I told them I WAS leaving the next day unless that test showed something.  The nurse who came in to give him antibiotics left the needle wrappers all over me and the cot.  They never checked his name to see that it was the right patient.  He was fine the next day.  They told me the test didn't show anything, but a couple of hours later I had to ask to get the paperwork to leave. It is like they forgot.   What amazed me the most was that I walked out with my child and no one bothered to check my name or anything.  I would have thought someone would have acknowledged me leaving or something, but no.  I never left him alone in the room so I never left the room for 24 hours.  I didn't know any of the staff except the ones that came in.  They didn't know me and didn't seem to care.  I could have been anyone just walking in off the street and stole a child.  It is that easy there.  The staff acted like teenagers working at the mall more interested in gossiping then working.  

As for the doctors clowning around, we did not have that experience.  We were charged $1250 both times with insurance.  I am not real sure how they justify that since we stayed 2 nights the first time and needed more attention.  The second son all they did was put a needle in his arm and antibiotics every 6 hours or so.  We did not recieve quality care or get attentive nurses/doctors.  It was a horrible experience and definitely do not recommend to anyone.  If you can take your child someone else, go somewhere else."
720,"Based on Dr. Pham's other (great) reviews, it seems I caught her on bad days. Both of my appointments have been rushed and impersonal. While she seemed very knowledgable, she did not take the time to talk to me at all or give me a chance to ask questions. She was hasty in my exam, which was very uncomfortable. 

On a positive note, both receptionists and the nurse I saw were all professional, personable and kind."
721,"I've been a patient at Sage Dental for two years now and they are the best. I really like that I'm never pushed into getting any treatment I don't absolutely need immediately. I've had dentists who do that and it makes me very uncomfortable. I love getting my teeth cleaned there! The hygienists are always awesome and do a great job. Each Dr I have seen has been wonderful. Once I had to have two fillings replaced and when it came time to get my shot (which I despise) the Dr did this thing with the side of my mouth, he vibrates it and I never even knew I had gotten the shot! Great dentists and great hygienists make this my go to for good! The office staff is always awesome too."
722,"I was referred to Mihail Rosca after hearing how wonderful he was at getting to the source of my friend's back pain. She said that after one session she felt a remarkable difference as his technique combined different forms of massage that gave her tremendous relief. I had been having bilateral pain in my IT bands due to redundant physical activity and the tightness that resulted was very uncomfortable.  I  had been going for physical therapy mostly for dry needling for quite a long time without great results. I contemplated getting a cortisone shot on each hip but instead I made a 90 minute appointment with Mihail and you can capitalize the ""t"" in Therapeutic massage. He uses a combination of Shiatsu, pressure point massage, deep tissue massage and sports massage. He understands the body and looks to get at the root of the problem and to put your body in balance and out of pain. The first massage was quite painful as Mihail worked on pressure points and at the same time manipulated my legs and after many repetitions the pain subsided and he went on to the next pressure point. I truly believe that the idiom ""no pain no gain"" exemplifies his technique and it is well worth pushing through the pain to get the relief
that he is able to achieve with his strong healing hands. I have now been to four sessions and feel remarkably better than I felt in a long time. He also gave me exercises that will enable me to continue to improve and I have every confidence under his guidance and care I will make a full recovery and be able to jog again, ride horses and feel good. Even though massage isn't covered by insurance though it should be since it can have far more therapeutic benefit  than physical therapy it is worth the cost because in the end it will enable me to stay active and feel good and that is priceless. I count my blessings and Mihail Rosca is one of them."
723,"I haven't experienced any problems with the staff, they are all very nice. Lach, however, is the only one I do not like. He is very rude, he does not greet you before shoving his hands in your mouth, instead of asking you a question like ""when was your last check up at the dentist?"" he asks the assistant ""when was his/her last check up at the dentist?"" only for the assistant to turn around and ask you the same question. 
I was there not long ago and he was extremely rude to one of the assistants, talking down to her and being extremely condescending. The assistant seemed a little lost (I think she was new) but the way he spoke to her was not a way that someone talks to an employee and especially not a way someone talks to an employee IN FRONT OF A CLIENT! Sitting in the chair, hearing the way he spoke to her made me very uncomfortable. It doesn't matter of she was new or simply having an off day, no one should ever be talked to like that."
724,"On July 13th I went with my son to Sage Dental. I was greeted by a nice staff who seem to be very kind and helpful. I was there for a basic cleaning of my teeth. I sat in the chair and waited. I was greeted by a military guy who was also kind and courteous. I explained that my gums have always been sensitive and that I am highly sensitive to hot and cold. I asked to make sire I am given a shot to num everything. He started with a blue gel that suppoed to num my gums. 

He insisted that the gel was very good and he would not hurt me. He started the cleaning and i was very uncomfortable. I could feel the cleaning tool. He started scraping my upper right tooth that holds my bridge. I was flinching in the chair and he kept saying im almost done. When he tried to continue i could not bear the pain and i would not let him continue.

He called yhe Doctor who Then came in and gave me shots. He continued looking at my bottom teeth to clean. He told me that the teeth had tarter and he recomened the orthadontist see me before he went any further.

My upper right tooth has been slowly hurting more and more each day since the cleaning attempt. I came to see the orthodontist who was very nice. She did not poke me with anything and told me she recommends the cleaning. I get a good feeling from her and I wish I had seen her first. I can feel a little hole in the roof of my mouth behind the tooth. I initially thought it was just because of the cleaning that it hurt s little bit. But now the tooth is starting to hurt. 

It's not my fault that my gums are sensitive. I have had this problem since I was a little boy. But I came in in for a cleaning and I now have a tooth ache. I'm calling first thing this morning. I'm not sure what to do now??"
725,"The office staff was rude, and my prescription was not correct.  The contacts prescribed were very uncomfortable.  Not only were they the wrong strength, they were the wrong size!

I tried to tell the doctor that my Accuvue Oasis for Astigmatism (which I've worn without problems for years) were my preference, and was told the doctor, not the patient, decides the type of contact to be prescribed.  So after several exams and trying different contacts the doctor likes that made it feel like my eyes were about to bleed, I cut my losses and went to Costco (where I got great service and the right prescription and lenses the first time, and for less money).    

I might as well have flushed the money I paid Eye Columbus down the toilet.  I don't care if they think they are trendy or something.  The service is horrible."
726,"Unfortunately the insurance that I have is the Medicaid for my children. The reason I say unfortunately is because unfortunately people judge you when you have that. The doctor here was very very sweet the male and female. Unfortunately most of your visit will be spent with different people there. I wish I could give different reviews for the doctor and the ladies that are sitting where you pick out your glasses. There's two young ladies with brown hair real then. They are very unhelpful you could tell by their face they don't like the job and don't bother asking them a question they'll make it look like you're bothering them and let it be known that they don't want to mess with you and you can wait for someone else just by the look on their face. Now let's talk about the reason I am only giving two stars to this place. There is a bigger woman that sits there next to those two girls she loves to stare at people as they're trying to pick out glasses and make you feel very uncomfortable. It's like you can't even think while looking at glasses or try them on or any of that without her staring at you or telling you which one she thinks you should get. As I was hurrying to pick out glasses for my child because I didn't want this woman's eyeballs on me anymore I overheard her telling her coworker about the way her body looks and I thought these comments were so unprofessional and I was not anxious to check out with her but it looked like the other two girls weren't going to help me so lucky me I get to stay with negative Nancy that's not her name but will just call her that. She sits on the desk that's closest to the glasses you can't miss her she's the one that stares at you the entire time you're in that area and as her two cents in even when you're not asking. I really wish I had a positive experience at this place because I've been here before in the past and I enjoyed myself but this time around I will not be going back because this woman made me feel so uncomfortable. Just a note for future customers only come here if you want to be oogled the entire time you are looking for a pair of glasses. I like to take my time On these things like glasses because they're going to be on your face for the next year, but unfortunately you cannot take your time here because there's someone rushing you and staring at you and telling you what they think you should get. You are not helpful lady please back up sit down and stop staring at customers and making them feel uncomfortable. Wait until somebody asked you a question to talk. Nobody wants your unsolicited advice."
727,"Fong Massage Therapy is an insult to massage therapy. I have never received such awful bodywork. Fong is very poorly trained, and the tables are made out of something like tin, which is very uncomfortable. She even burped in my face, as she was working on my shoulders, as I was sitting upright. I had heard that Kathy was good, so I made another appointment, but all she did was moan about politics, while I was trying to relax. Very unskilled, and I doubt she's had any formal training in massage. She was even worse than Fong, and very unpleasant. Not to mention, the old lady at the front of the office does a shakedown, as you're leaving to pressure you to leave a tip in their tip jar. This place is disgusting. I doubt they have any qualifications/licenses to be a legitimate massage therapy practice. Just awful. AVOID AVOID AVOID."
728,"I picked up my glasses yesterday, wore them for two hours and found the frames very uncomfortable.  As such, I attempted to return them in-store the next day for a refund.  I presented the glasses and receipt, and was told they could no do a return because the two  employees present ""didn't know how"".  I asked if I could go to a different store to process the return and I was told I could not.  I find this to be absolutely ridiculous, unacceptable as well as an unethical business practice."
729,This office is in network and Dr. Andrew Kim got good reviews. I tried calling the number listed in on my insurance and got transferred to a call center with the most horrible unpleasant people on earth who could answer no questions for me. They named the wrong dentist office upon answering. I asked to be transferred to the actual dentist office and they said they couldn't then asked me which city I wanted to talk to. The whole thing felt very uncomfortable.
730,"Although there is a very good hygienist there, and the staff is very nice, this is not a good dental practice, steer clear!  If you have to do something more than a cleaning, not so good.

First, I have been to a few dental practices here in Atlanta where the practice is named for a particular dentist.  But, when you make an appointment, or show up for your appointment, there is another dentist.  One whose name is no where listed and certainly one who you were not expecting.  In fact, it seems common that a dental practice advertises itself based on one dentist, who may have all kinds of accolades, but some independent contractor dentist (who may or may not be any good) is who comes into the exam room after you have few other choices--I mean, you cannot leave without paying an office visit fee..you cannot ask to see the other dentist without creating a strange and perhaps hostile environment for yourself.  So, in general, it is probably a good idea to ask for the dentist that you would like to see.  Do not just ask for an appointment.

Anyway...I do my best to take care of my teeth, so I believe that many dentists look in my mouth and see dollar signs.  One of my crowns broke in half and in such a way that was very uncomfortable.  I saw a dentist (some guy with a long, non-familiar name whose name is nowhere to be seen or remembered) who, instead of helping me, perceived me as being powerless and took advantage of my terrible situation.  He tried to bully me into pulling my tooth out and get an implant, instead of just fixing my broken crown.  I was given a quote for lots of money and a promise to deal with this tooth issue for many, many, many more months to come (your tooth is pulled and then there is a gap, and then it has to heal.  After which time, they insert a screw into your jaw and allow that to heal over before they install the implant..and you may still have problems like recurring abscesses-even though you don't even have a tooth there any more). When I asked about alternatives, he said that that was my option.

I was so upset at the prospect of having to have a tooth removed that I had to step outside to compose myself.  Outside the practice, I consulted with a few folks via phone, who after consoling me, recommended that I get a second opinion.  The staff knows the dentist to be aggressive and encouraged me to  make an appointment with Dr. Gordon because I would have received a better exam and recommendation.  To that, I say, ""Bull****!""  Her practice is in the business of making money unethically.

I then went to a respected endodontist who recommended re-cleaning the original root canal and re-crowning.  This option is a lot less invasive, and certainly less expensive (although not inexpensive by any means) and will be more quickly resolved than the ultimatum of the mystery-named dentist at Gordan Family Dentistry (he is not listed on their website, I am not even sure he is a dentist).

In addition to this awful experience, I have also had to call them multiple times regarding the bill for that visit, during which time the dentist did not help me and made things very frustrating and time-consuming for me.  They charged me over $96.  My insurance paid $75 and I paid the difference on time.  They are still sending bills trying to receive payment from the portion that my insurance company paid almost 3 months ago.  

I called them on it and they told me that the insurance company sent the check to me (of course, they submitted the claim to my insurance company and indicated where the payment should be sent).  I never received any check, and I suspect fraud by this company so I did not believe them.  It looks like they caused a billing issue on my end that would require me to pay them the entire $96 (lest I receive a ding on my credit report and have a creditor harassing me).  Then, they would receive a check for $75 from the insurance company. In the end, I would have overpaid $75, and I would get a credit with them (places like this do not issue checks for their  billing ""mistakes"") to use against any services that I receive from them.  They deceive me, I pay cash and they return lousy dentist credit.  Sounds like a game to me.  Now, I have to call my insurance company to sort this out.  I have never had a payment issue like this before.

Very dishonest company.  I know that they have an international client-base.  I hope they are not using these tactics to defraud people who may have few resources or language barriers."
731,"Customer service was deplorable... employees are extremely rude....and the facility is so dirty, smelled of cigarettes, unsanitary-

My experience has been a nightmare, From the start, it seemed shady...unprofessional. They didn't explain options and pricing clearly.  On a piece of paper, he made a hand-drawing to explain options, scheduling, pricing. It was so confusing- it felt like he was making it up as he went. Of course, the whole time, trying to sell me more expensive services. I felt so pressured. It was very uncomfortable. 
Because I am an on-call Midwife, I had to cancel an appointment and asked that an exception be made, they still charged me $100 to cancel my appointment. Eventually I got him to agree to a $50. charge. This employee (owner?)  his behavior is borderline abusive, very rude, very crude. I couldn't believe how disrespectful he was. And although I have 1 more appointment left on the package I purchased, I have decided to not go. I am done with this company--No more."
732,"I didn't have a good experience at this dentist. I arrived early for my appointment expecting to be seen on time, but I ended up having to wait an extra 30 minutes before even going inside. Once I sat down in the chair I had to wait another 20 minutes and the environment was very uncomfortable. When they got started, one hygienist asked another if she was able to take my Xrays. She responded stating ""I am not sure how but I will try and ask you if I have any questions."" She ended up not being able to figure it out and the other hygienist had to take over. Given that I am only able to get Xrays every given number of years this was extremely stressful and made me want to leave and go somewhere else. The dentist himself was the only pleasant part; he answered all my questions and made conversation with me. After he left, he had the hygienist do the cleaning. The entire cleaning lasted 5 minutes at the most. She didn't floss or brush my teeth or remove any plaque (which is very important because I have a metal bar on the back of my teeth). The reason I was there was for a routine cleaning, so I was extremely confused about why they skipped over this part of the visit. The ladies at the front desk were very nice on my way out, but overall this was definitely the worst dentist experience I have ever had. I would like to hope that it isn't always like this and I just had a rare bad experience, but unfortunately, I will not be going back to this office."
733,"I did not have a large selection when choosing, I was trying to find someone fast around the holidays. He works out of his house, that was not so comfortable. He is a meak thin man and speaks so soft that it is very hard to hear him and you constantly have to ask him to repeat. I went to him for ADD meds since in Texas you have to go to a Psychiatrist. I did not like him from the first visit and I felt very uncomfortable. He also asked me about my childhood sexual abuse, which it had nothing to do with my ADD I was there for.
Some times we would sit there in silence....I was unsure what to say or do...When he asked ""How are things""?...If I told him something that wasn't good or bothering me, he would not offer any advise or say anything,,,we just sat there looking at each other.
He will not call or give reminder notice. For someone with ADD memory problems this is NO HELP! But he sure will call you after you miss and charge you for missing the appointment! 
Even though he charged the insurance $200.00 for about 5 minutes to write the perception, and me a $20.00 co pay. At that rate per person you think he could get an assistant, Not paying office space, and the 5 minutes appointments back to back...what the hell..???
In the end I only continued to go because I could get in and out in under 10 minutes with my prescription in hand. ****If you do need real help go elsewhere.
*** And who the hell is Andrew G?? really are you real? or an paid actor?***"
734,"I switched my dental insurance just so I would never have to go to this place again. This happened in summer 2014, but I was reminded to write this review when I received advertising from BrightNow that I didn't sign up for. 

The dental hygienist made inappropriate and unprofessional comments about me and my appearance repeatedly throughout the visit. She made me very uncomfortable.

First she assumed, without asking, that I was a college student, and asked me what my major was (I'm 23/female, and a full-time computer engineer at a major tech company just blocks from the dental office). It took several tries to get the idea across that I am an adult with a career. She made repeated comments about how ""young and pretty"" I looked. Excuse me? That's not an appropriate thing to say to the woman whose gums you're scraping. 

Apparently she still didn't get the memo that I am an adult, because she proceeded to treat me like a child for the rest of the visit. I admitted I need to floss more after seeing the beginnings of a cavity in my Xrays. For the rest of the visit, she pressured me about flossing in an extremely condescending way. I had told her several times that I understood and would be flossing more.  She came back with a book showing the progression of gingivitis and practically shoved it in my face, pointing out the pictures, even after I told her I'd gotten the point and it wasn't necessary. For the record, I have been flossing more, but all I needed to see was the X-rays; I didn't need to be treated like a petulant 5 year old who refuses to brush her teeth. 

Oh, and the technology was ancient. Ugh."
735,"I went here to get my teeth looked at, I needed on pulled, they wanted to pull another and do a root canel and they gave me a flip which didn't fit right, very uncomfortable.. they dentist said"" let's fit you before the tooths comes out?? i dunno why... flipper I got didn't fit really, very uncomfortable.. i rather go without and SAY GOODBYE TO $500 I had to pay in credit card... THANKS FOR NOTHING... BAD PICK, DON""T GO THERE.. RIP OFF SCAMS.."
736,"Dr. Vargas is extremely knowledgeable. She was able to treat me when I suffered from a corneal ulcer. But I went through a TERRIBLE experience with her staff. They are unprofessional and did not seem to comprehend my order for my contacts. 

I went through an excruciating long process with her staff to get my contacts ordered. It took 2 months and a half to finally get my contacts. Not only that but they ended up giving me an incomplete box for my left eye. 

I just placed an order myself for a new pack of contacts through 1-800-CONTACTS. I wanted to switch brands because the ones given to me by Dr. Vargas staff were very uncomfortable. 1-800-CONTACTS had to contact the staff in Dr. Vargas' office and they STILL do not have my records straight. They gave 1-800-CONTACTS the wrong brand for my right and the wrong power for my left. 

It has been an extreme pain working with her staff. If you go to Provista Eye Clinic, I recommend you talking to Dr. Vargas to make sure all your records are correct."
737,"I freakin' hate hospitals and avoid them until avoiding them is no longer an option, but after the meds from my urgent care visit earlier in the week proved ineffective and the pain grew ever more unbearable, avoidance was no longer an option.

I'd never been to OSUMC before, just knew it was the closest hospital to my house. I had a few experiences early into this visit that really turned me off from it...  initially:

Turnoff number one was the construction going on around OSUMC - lanes closed, confusing parking, signs and traffic patterns. We pulled into what we guessed to be the ER area (we were luckily correct) and a not-super-friendly security guard showed him where to park and pointed me to the ER doors.

Turnoff number two: Walking through the ER doors and then being forced to walk through a metal detector and have my purse searched. I would like to think of a hospital as a safe, healing place. Not an airport security zone. Very uncomfortable.

Turnoff number three: After checking in at the pre-registration past the security guard (who somehow switched my first and last name?) I had to check in with not one, but two other people. Three checkins. Explaining what's wrong with me to three people, who are NOT the actual medical personnel who can help me who I will have to explain this all again to later.

HOWEVER, despite all of that... it was a very positive experience. First of all, from the time I walked through the metal detector and went through all my disparate checkins to the time I got into an exam room was under 15 minutes, and just another 5 before a doctor came to see me. I've been to emergency rooms in 4 different hospitals, and have NEVER had such a short wait time. I also didn't have to fill out a crapton of paperwork - any, actually. They asked me the few questions they needed during the checkins. I did nothing more than sign my name.

The doctors and the nurses who worked with me were very helpful, friendly and instructive. And they got me in and out of there FAST -  I spent about 30 minutes in the exam room.

The only other ER I've been to in Columbus is Grant. By comparison, OSUMC is roughly 525 times better."
738,"Yelp! Is great...

I can not say I have an issue with my treatment.


Just reading these reviews, I have major concerns outside Dr. Hodkins: quality control, consistency, professionalism and high employee turnover in just two years?


, 
I made an appointment with Dr. Hodgins and another, anonymous dentist pulled the tooth and did the graft. It happened so fast. I waited 45 mins, early September, they had three people out with the flu. No contagions from Orlando's famous homeless here, Dawn had $2,700 pre authorized before the dentist even started. Very money savvy staff.




I was told it was a non stitch that had to be removed around two weeks, yet a week later it broke, when I called, AROUCHE told me that the stitch was a dissolving stitch and I should cut it myself. 



After cutting it I realized the assistant who guided me on the phone was wrong it stronger that bakery twine.

I had needed the extracted tooth back and xrays due to my preferred by five touchdowns, expert, highly acclaimed dentist, Dr. Barry Sporer, (since 2000) telling me to seek satisfaction for a botched service from another dentist, IN NEW YORK. BUT...



A deal breaker... They never intended to honor.



Anonymous Dentist, told me he forgot, already dumped tooth in bio waste, never gave me receipt or my agreed xrays.

 When I was very professionally explained about where treatment was headed, was told to use freeze dried cadaver graft however when researching economical implant options a week later, I ran into a top dentist in NY metro with offices in three upper class offices, Eric Linden on realfself.com who says grafts should never be unilaterally decided by Dentist, Cadaver here, or by the anonymous Junior Dentist on staff, no business card, no name in web site! No receipt.

Autograft (patient's own bone), synthetic or freeze dried cadaver even if one is better suited, patient's choice unequivocally.

Emails to staff are are all unanswered: Dawn who assisted the extraction and graft, Jennifer the office manager, info@

I have a gut call, they post signs in each room,  these great value adds like iPod and neck cushion, but never offer them. They were professional but very guarded, no small talk initiation,  and aloof. Felt like a number to these ""exceptional people"". 

The black and white portraits with huge crosses pendants are very uncomfortable. I am from NY we embrace all religions cultures worldwide. No phobia, no judgment we are not threatened. Our ""cognitive dissonance"" is who is better Giants or Jets.....


I came because of Yelp not religion and more accurate healthgrades.com were average at best, HINDSIGHT.

739,"Worse Hospital in Columbus. Looks like they have Teen Agers running the entire ER. They make you wait in line no matter how sick you are to screen you for weapons. I felt like I was at the Airport. Plus the security are very rude and act like military police in another country. The ER is very dirty. Seats are very uncomfortable. If you are very sick, in agony and worse pain every suffored they didn't care. Told me to go sit down! I was suffering and no one was there to help me. Gave me the cold shoulder. Horrible hospital. Plus even with insurance Igot bills that went threw the Attorney General for $10. Ohio State is in my opinion the worse in Columbus. They have no heart for their patrons."
740,"Wow. Maybe it's because I'm used to the overcrowded, unclean, perpetually-behind-schedule atmosphere of NYC doctors' offices (where I just moved from), but I am so happy with my experience here that I am moved to write my first Yelp review ever. 

I'll keep it snappy. 
Front desk was very accommodating about taking me for a same-day appointment. The receptionist even seemed concerned about my ailment, which was not at all serious, but very uncomfortable. 

Sweet little office, very clean and comfortable. 

I was seen within 10 minutes of my appointment time. The nurse who took my vitals actually seemed to care about me, and made me feel at ease. 

Amy, the P.A. who came to see me in the exam room was, in a word, awesome. Great bedside manner, very easy to talk to, and thorough but efficient. She had me out of there with a prescription in 10 minutes, but I didn't feel rushed. She even called a few days later to check on me. 

The whole experience was beyond pleasant, and I don't say that easily about a visit to the doctor. I will definitely be signing up with these folks as my primary care providers."
741,"I am catching up on my reviews, so the experience that I want to share is from the end of last year and early this year. 
I went to this dental office after a friend of a friend recommended them. My first few visits were amazing -- the cleaning was gentle and thorough and Dr Schuyler even polished my restorations to fit me better for free. 
Then at my next checkup she decided that one of my restorations (fillings) needed replacement and considering the size of it it needed to be replaced with a crown. I had no symptoms and just went with her advice. 
She installed a crown and I started developing terrible pain soon after, which resulted in me needing a root canal treatment. I went in for that soon after and had the most painful dental experience of my life. Even after all the anesthesia shots I still felt a lot of pain and moaned and groaned, but the Dr didn't seem to pay attention as she was busy discussing holiday preparations with her assistant. I ended up actually stopping her and telling her that I was in a lot of pain and asking if that was normal after the local anesthesia shots. She proceeded to give me another shot right into the canal and ended up hitting a nerve. I can't even describe the agonizing pain that that caused. I was literally crying from pain, but the Dr just laughed it off and proceeded talking about holidays while sticking those painful files (needles) into my open root canals. After she was done she installed a new crown, which from the start felt very uncomfortable. The Dr said I had to wait until next day to see if it really didn't fit well, even though I already felt it was sitting too high against my other teeth causing a very uncomfortable and annoying bite. Sure enough, once the anesthesia wore off, it became even more uncomfortable. I couldn't even sleep that night because of discomfort in my mouth. I called them the next morning and another Dr adjusted the crown for me later in the day. He was very thorough with checking and rechecking how it fit after every tiny adjustment that he did. I am not sure why Dr Schuyler couldn't have done the same while she was installing it.

Important point to add -- I ended up paying for both, the crown and the root canal that was caused by the initial installation of the crown.

My husband also had a terrible experience with this place. His first few appointments were fine just like mine, but at his second cleaning he ended up being billed for a deep cleaning instead of a regular one. He never agreed to a deep cleaning in writing or even verbally, and it was not included in any of his treatment plan papers that he was given at his first appointment. It took around 10 phone calls and one mailed letter to resolve the bill and for them to adjust the charge to a regular cleaning. 

Needless to say we took our business elsewhere."
742,I've been going here for a while and never had a bad experience (and trust me I hate the dentist). But the last two times I had Dawna (the daughter of the owner) and she was deplorable. Just her overall demeanor and egotistical approach made both myself and the assistant very uncomfortable. Extremely disappointing since the staff here has always been super friendly and welcoming. She wouldn't take any advice from the assistant and was ruthless with picking at my teeth. I know the picking is normal practice but I'm smart enough to know it was overboard. If you're looking for a mouth full of pain after simple cleaning and bunch of cocky attitude on the side then this is your place. Otherwise I'd say stay away.
743,"PLEASE READ ABOUT MY HORRIBLE EXPERIENCE BEFORE GOING!! BE WARNED!

I've been a loyal customer to Treat Your Feet for the past four years. I've recommended their services to multiple friends, family members, co-workers and sorority sisters. However, recently I've started noticing their customer services have shifted in the wrong direction. VERY DISAPPOINTING! 

My most recent visit was by far the WORST EXPERIENCE I've ever had!! My masseuse (Rita) appeared very distracted and bored of her work. As she was massaging me, she started laughing which prompted me to wake up. She was resting her head against the wall, while she was playing with my feet. VERY UNPROFESSIONAL! So, I decided to cut my one hour foot massage to only 30 minutes because I felt very uncomfortable. And I wanted to get out of there as quickly as possible. Her techniques were forceful and aggressive. She ramped hot stones up and down my shins and started bending my feet in awkward positions. Now my right ankle is strain!!! 

Upon checking out, I paid for my service and decided not to tip for the horrible service. (Standard tipping practice in USA) So, the girl in the front desk proceeded to ask me ""Are you going to leave a tip for your masseuse?"" I told her ""NO."" As I was heading to my car, my masseuse (Rita) ran out the door and yelled ""Did you leave me a tip?"" I told her ""NO!"" SHE FOLLOWED ME TO MY CAR and yelled ""Why? Didn't you tip me?"" I quickly reply by telling her ""I am not going tip you for a horrible service!"" I was very frighten by her;  as she followed me to my car! Needless to say I was taken aback by her confrontational disposition. 

Treat Your Feet has lost a loyal customer!!! I will NEVER step foot in there again!!!"
744,"You get your ultrasound, but I wouldn't say they care at all about their patients here. When I got there, I waited at reception for about 5 minutes, and then when one of the women of the office saw me, I smiled, and she looked confused. I told her I had an appointment and wanted to sign-in, and looked very annoyed, rolled her eyes at me, then told me to sit down as she walked away. Luckily a different woman came by and signed me in. They kept the a/c on very high in the reception area to the point where several people waiting mentioned how cold it was, but kept it a normal temperature in the actual appointment area. Once inside, I was assisted by a very unhappy nurse who seemed less than pleased to have to lead me to a room and tell me where to sit. She was unhelpful and looked annoyed. I felt uncomfortable answering her questions and letting her help me pull down my clothing. Then, after waiting rather exposed in the room, the doctor came in. She was much more friendly and did do the test, but it was very fast and didn't seem thorough. There wasn't much explanation of what she was doing, or asking me any questions or even a recognition of the pain the second ultrasound was causing. She said she didn't find anything in my tests, had me get dressed, and had me leave. I don't know if this is all my doctor requested of them to look at but it felt quick, unprofessional and very uncomfortable. I don't plan on ever returning here and I wouldn't recommend it to anyone."
745,"I had a small biopsy taken and was told I could find the results within two weeks on the portal; after two weeks I had to call them to get my results, which still a month later have not shown up on the portal. Also, Dr. Adelman was very flippant and, in my opinion, unprofessional during my exam, and the comments he was making toward his assistant while doing my exam seemed suggestive and made me very uncomfortable."
746,"I have always been a fan of the concept of Planned Parenthood. But after my first visit, I love it even more!!

I tried to make an appointment online at the Boston location, but they were all full up. They let me know that the Somerville location is best for walk-ins on Saturdays. So off I went to Davis (very easy to get to on the T). I had to wait about 45 minutes but no complaints, they have a decent selection of magazines and I had to fill out some paperwork.

The woman who first went over my info was incredibly nice. She asked me some routine questions, took my weight and BP and asked me if I had any questions before seeing the Nurse Practitioner. 

The NP was wonderful. She was such a sweetheart and she took the time to explain a lot of stuff to me. Turns out, some new research has shown that due to some other medical conditions, I may not have been on the safest method of b/c for the last few years. She went over everything in great detail, answered all my questions, and sent me home with some literature to best understand everything. 

And THANK YOU Planned Parenthood for making b/c so accessible. I went home with a 3 month supply, so I only need to stop in every few months. The receptionist was also very honest about costs of everything. We talked about prices using my insurance vs. buying out of pocket. Very informative. 

They made me feel very comfortable talking about a subject that can so often be very uncomfortable. This smaller location also offers STI testing and the Plan B pills (for about $20 less than at CVS!!). I highly recommend it. And if you need services that they don't offer, they can hook you up with an appointment at the Boston location."
747,"I made an appointment Tuesday for Saturday.  I was contacted at noon on Friday to let me know that the therapist I requested is no longer working there and that they cannot accommodate my gender request at any time this weekend.  Was told that she would have the manager call me right back, but I still am waiting on that call.  

I am supposed to be getting weekly massage appointments per doctor's orders post car wreck, but it seems that I will not be using Village Health for any of those appointments.  Friday notice for a weekend appointment is just not ok - it doesn't give you any time to reschedule with a reputable massage therapist at any of the convenient locations as they're normally booked.

Update: They did call to offer a free massage, but I believe they also took the time to post to Yelp before calling me.  I did decline the massage when called as I believe first impressions matter and the appointment was not at the requested time, contrary to the note below.  I'm not usually high maintenance and I'm not looking for free service, just service that I am able to rely on.  Anyone trying to make a massage appointment knows that it's practically impossible to get in for the weekend if you wait until Friday to call so this didn't leave me with other options.  And I will also admit to having a very bad day and was a bit upset at the thought of having to wait an entire week for a massage as I'm very uncomfortable.

The manager did call a few hours later to apologize personally, so I am upgrading the review to a 2.  It's still not ""A-OK"" as they didn't actually offer me an appointment at my requested time as stated in their response so I actually am not able to get an appointment this weekend that would work with my schedule."
748,"Last summer, one of my back molars broke. I hadn't been to a dentist in ages, and there was a bad cavity. So I went to Tech Dentistry. No problem, right?

They gave me a root canal without medication. Here, let me repeat that-

THEY GAVE ME A ROOT CANAL WITHOUT MEDICATION.

The crown they gave me was so flimsy it broke within five months. I went to a REAL dentist, who didn't even know what the crown's material was.

Also- the one MD there is awful. He is very overly friendly. He was constantly touching me and calling me by pet names. It made me very uncomfortable.

But not as uncomfortable as the unmedicated root canal."
749,I was diagnosed with polycythemia today. I need to have a pint of blood taken. I am very uncomfortable. I denied help by the emergency room at 11113 Research Blvd. I walked out of Seton Round Rock because they would just left me there. These hospitals are terrible. I am uncomfortable and they won't help. Typical western medicine. Thanks for nothing Seton.
750,"I had a great experience here from receptionist to appointment with one complaint. The staff was friendly and the chiropractor was great I'd never seen one and he was incredibly helpful and upbeat. Happy to answer any questions. I had a massage immediately after. I've had tons of massages but this was my first one covered by insurance so I wasn't sure what to expect. The guy who massaged me was alright but I would HIGHLY advise him to do two things for the comfort of women. ASK first if they are ok with having their bottom massaged. He went for it and I've never had anyone do that. Just to be on the safe side ask. Also when he was done with my back he had me turn over and scoot down. I would 100% expect them to say, ""alright go ahead, I'm looking away"" but instead he lifted the covers and looked right down while I was turning over on my back with my bare chest facing up. That made me very uncomfortable. I don't think there was any bad intent, he was a nice man but my two cents would be to prioritize the clients comfort and privacy. 

I did get a reply and a massage from Jackie who was just amazing. I'll be back for sure. She looked away when I turned over during massage and didn't initiate conversation repeatedly like the other guy. Glad I was able to return."

752,"I have been going to Tufts for multiple dental implants for two and a half years now and I have gone through hell ! The student dentist was like a car salesman with a very poor and not-so-gentle bedside manner.  He kept telling me that he was ""giving me his discount.""  He spoke with a thick foreign accent and had a difficult time communicating the dental treatment plan.  He would tell me one thing and then I would find out later on that what he told me was inaccurate.  He flip flopped in statements about my treatment.   I A serious infection was knowingly left in my mouth.  I was in pain and they told me to go home and rinse with warm water and salt or peroxide.  I suffered for nine months with a painful infection that was oozing. I had numerous teeth extracted in the oral surgery department and was immediately sent after the surgery with no teeth and a swollen painful mouth upstairs to my dentist without any Tylenol/ibuprofen or ice packs.  The dentist began to push dentures into my swollen mouth and take them out again repeatedly without any concern for the pain that I was feeling.  He was filing the temporary dentures inches away from me and the dust was flying all over me and up my nose and all over my clothes while he continued to wet the dentures and drip it he water all over my clothes.  I finally had enough after 5 hours of torture when one of the dental assistants told my dentist that his time was up in that chair and that he needed to give the chair to the next dentist. At that point, I became frustrated, and started crying....I lost it and caused a Scene in front of all the other patients in the clinic.  Needless to say, I am very embarrassed about my actions, However, this was a building up of two years of frustration and changing treatment plans as well as lack of communication and misinformation.  At some point, I was later told that the multiple implants cannot be done because of bone loss that was caused by an infection that was left for a lengthy period of time.  The dentist told me that the bone loss was caused by the infection and when I complained and met with the head of the prosthodontics unit, he told me that what the dentist told me is not true and that the infection was not the cause of the bone loss.  The story changed from person to person about the cause of the bone loss and the reason for not being able to do the implants as initially planned.  The dentist has repeatedly given me information that I am later told something different by either the head of the department of the teaching faculty.  There have been times when I have felt so confused and frustrated over the poor communication and conflicting information and continuous change in treatment plan that I have broken down in tears.   I cant begin to tell you how disappointed and frustrated I am.  I wish I could turn back time because I would choose to spend the extra money on a real dentist.  I am now still without upper implants.  I am wearing temporary dentures that don't fit properly and are very uncomfortable.  I had lower dentures made that did not fit at all and that I never wore.  I paid $800 for the lower dentures and have repeatedly asked for a refund.  For several months that request went ignored.  It wasn't until I complained to the business manager that I was told I would get refunded.  But Still have not seen the refund.  I have paid almost 19000 dollars and they have been holding my money in an interest bearing bank account for two and a half years.  I feel like I am trapped.  They have my money and I have no teeth after all this time.   Bottom line........Do not go here !!!!  You will be sorry.........."
753,"I really do get the feeling that this company is overcompensating for their lack of experience or, maybe something else. They go the extra mile to reel you in, like give you a great deal on your first visit or hand out free food and drinks in the lobby...but the last few times I have been, I have left feeling scammed and not taken care of. The last 2 visits no one has even come to the front desk for 10 minutes. Things just  always seem quite unorganized when I am there. They have also told me and my husband things about our teeth that other dentists have disagreed with, and our teeth are always so much more sore after leaving their cleanings than any other dentist we have seen. These are just 2 of many reasons that we have left their practice. 

We gave it a good shot, but something about this place makes me feel very uncomfortable. Sorry sola dental!"
754,"Dr. Spaulding sees both me and my wife. Until recently I had a pretty average feeling on her and the practice. I had had good experiences but nothing over the top WOW. The facility is nice. The hygenists and Dr. Spaulding are both very nice and professional. They always seem to be really flexible with scheduling having extended hours one night a week even. But i feel like those qualities would lend to a 3 or 4 rating as most dentists worth their salt have these things. About 2 months ago my wife needed a medium level oral procedure. She came home and tried to explain it to me after the consult but I couldnt visualize it. So I called and Dr. Spaulding agreed to have a 2nd consult with us, squeezing us in to her busy schedule. After the procedure which went well my wife was in some pain and very uncomfortable. Dr Spaulding (not a secretary or hygenist) has called her 4 times in the past 2 weeks and even given my wife her personal cell number. She also agreed to allow her to have a follow up before her official follow up. That is A+ service in my book."
755,"Decided to give this place a try and truly regret it. First off, I waited in the lobby for about 35 mins and then had to wait a little longer once I was in the room. The assistant was trying to do a panoramic xray and the the instrument they usually have you bite down on was very uncomfortable. She kept trying and it didnt make it any better until another hygenist came in to try a different way. Then the guy came in to check my gums and suggested I needed a deep cleaning and I was close to having gum disease. This was news to me because I have pretty healthy teeth and usually go every 6 months to the dentist. They WILL NOT do a regular cleaning until you get their DEEP CLEANING treatment which I think every patient should have an option. I ended up not getting anything done and scheduled an appt with another office. Overall, I think the staff is inexperienced and they try to upsell a deep cleaning to everyone which is a complete ripoff. To me they have very fraudulent practices and they are money hungry people.I recommend getting a second opinion and finding another place to get your teeth cleaned"
756,"Miracle workers! I had issues with my lower back and it recently got very uncomfortable. Its generally very difficult for me to step away to see a doctor because I'm running two businesses. I work long hours and when I spoke with Dr. Linda and she was able to fit me in at the end of the night. When I came in, I was greeted by Minh. She's very friendly and was very helpful with checking me in. I was assigned with Dr. Cooper and he was very helpful. He explained what his diagnosis was and explained it in a way that a person without much knowledge in the medical field could understand. He made a few adjustments to my lower back and immediately I felt a lot better! I went home and slept through the night for the first time in the past 3 weeks. I woke up this morning feeling a lot better and didn't have the pain the sharp pain that I was feeling before. I'm so grateful for the staff at Accident Care! Thank you so much for everything!!!"
757,"I had a root canal performed here many years ago. Both Dr. Santamaria and Dr. Warshauer participated in the procedure. It wasn't done very expeditiously, but I assumed the dentists had done an acceptable job. However, the crown never felt right. I have no other crowns, so I just assumed it was supposed to feel odd. Bits of food constantly got impacted there, and it was very uncomfortable. Several years later, a good dentist pointed out that the crown was extremely ill-fitting. There was, in dental jargon, a very obvious short distal margin, and the gingival tissue in the area was very inflamed. I called Dr. Warshauer & Santamaria's office to see what could be done (by then, I had moved to a different state), and the receptionist was exceptionally rude. She took a very accusatory tone and suggested that I was lying or attempting to somehow exploit my complaint. I was so upset by the encounter that I never called back. 

I ended up having the root canal redone by a skilled endodontist, and he discovered that on top of the ill-fitting crown, Dr. Santamaria and Dr. Warshauer had completely missed an entire canal. My general dentist fitted me with a new crown, and it feels drastically better than the old one. 

Long story short: Don't go here. And never get a root canal done by a general dentist. Always go to an endodontist, a specialist in root canals."
758,I was seen by Dr. Keane Hung and not sure if he was having a bad day but my visit very uncomfortable. In my history of hospital visits I don't think I've ever experienced rudeness from a doctor. I had been having respiratory issues and difficulty sleeping. I had been seeing various healthcare professionals and was giving a breakdown of what I had been trying so far. As I tried explaining the reason for my visit to Dr. Hung it felt as if I sounded absurd for explaining my point of view and he was very dismissive. It immediately made me feel unsafe and wanted to leave asap. I hope this isn't the case for every patient but I didn't feel reassured as I left the ER.
759,"My experience at Providence Milwaukie was.....strange.  Medically effective, but there was a weird vibe at the ER that would make me think twice about going there again. 

The girrl took me in  around 8pm on a Sunday night with a bad stomach bug.  I was dehydrated, and could barely walk. The ER waiting room and the ER itself was not crowded, and actually quiet, just a few patients.

Basically, they took me into the ER, rehydrated me, gave me some anti-nausea meds and some prescriptions, and sent me home. 

I think I'll just do two lists - a good/proficient list, and a bad/weird list. 

Good/Proficient:

-  Quick into  Triage

-  Quick into a room in the ER

- Facility was clean, modern

- Proficient IV start up - it's not easy to start an IV on a dehydrated patient

- Swiftly seen by MD, who seemed efficient and kind

- Anti nausea meds were prescribed and started quickly

- I was checked frequently by medical professionals - one or the other of the nurses was in the room about 2/3s of the time, and the doctor came in 3 times

Bad/Weird:

- The triage nurse was very brusque and abrasive - almost hostile 

- The two nurses (both male) who were assigned to me had some sort of sparring thing going on - sardonic and a little too much.  One of them toned it down some when he saw how sick I actually was, but it was almost on the edge of unprofessional

- When I complimented the nurse on the IV set up (minimal pain on the needle stick), he said thanks, then made some off-color remark to the other nurse about 'getting lots of practice' at some dive-sounding local motel.  (WTF? Not funny, dude) The other nurse just laughed. 

- The two units of IV fluids I was given were full-bore open.  This was not medically necessary, and made me physically very uncomfortable. I was too sick to protest coherently, and the girrl didn't know.  Retrospectively, it felt like a time-saving measure.  There was no need - the ER was quiet, they didn't need to hurry me out to free a bed.  

- When I finally shuffled out with my paperwork, I knew I had to stop at the reception desk and pay my co-pay.  So I walked up to the desk, there was a dark-haired woman sitting there.  She said something like ""what can I do for you"" and I said ""I need to pay you"".  She started laughing.  It was weird.  Some other woman came up to the desk, and the first one shoved my paperwork over to her.  I turned to deal with the other woman, and the first one kept laughing, and repeating to herself ""I need to pay you"".  If I had been more with it, I would have turned back to her and said that I didn't get the joke.  It was strange, and offensive. 

I was far too ill to do anything but go home and go to bed, but I've been thinking about my experiences, have revisited them through the lens of the girrl, and we agree - Providence Milwaukie ER is medically proficient, but weird.  The whole experience left me with an uneasy feeling."
760,Went and saw Ted 2!! Great movie. I do like this watching movies here but the seats are narrow and very uncomfortable. I have been to several other places and there is a much better option they could have gone with
761,"I'm extremely disappointed with Doctors Express. We weren't seen until 30 minutes after our appointment time. The front desk staff was unfriendly, unprofessional, and discourteous. The PA who examined my 10-year-old son asked him if he has a wife and made him very uncomfortable. When I asked him a question he responded to me in a condescending way. Suffice to say, We won't be back."
762,Made me very uncomfortable. He was very rough while cleaning my teeth and told me to stop after I started wiping the blood away with a tissue!? I will be bringing my business elsewhere!
763,"I've suffered from back problems for years and recently ended up in urgent care in the middle of the night with pain so bad I thought it might be my appendix. I figured it was time to try a chiropractor and I couldn't be happier with the treatment and care I've received from Dr. Morgan and his staff.

Dr. Morgan takes his time really assessing my problems and after a few visits I was pain free. I appreciate that our plan isn't just a back adjustment -- Dr. Morgan's approach to my wellness has included exercises both at the office and through an online program at home to help strengthen my core.

Just this week I tweaked my lower back and was feeling very uncomfortable. I wasn't scheduled to come in this week but I called and they got me in right away. I'm happy to report that today I'm pain free again! 

I can't recommend West End Chiropractic enough."
764,"UPDATE: I DO NOT SUGGEST THIS BUSINESS ESPECIALLY FOR YOUNG WOMEN. The man who runs this business is NOT professional. He kept trying to impress me about what great shape he was in when he was 25, and to prove it, he pulled out a pair of pants he used to wear (from a messy cupboard) and held them up and waited for me to comment about what I thought about his previous waist size, AND HE HELD THEM UP FOREVER. He then brought out a personal photo album and kept me and my boyfriend (because I invited my boyfriend in to the room, because I was uncomfortable) for over 30 minutes explaining every picture in it to me, and waiting for our reaction of his life when he was 25 wearing those pants. He tried inviting us to his house. We had 3 total chiropractic adjustments from this man, and I had to have my boyfriend in the room for the last two because I was not comfortable.  And even with him in the room, we were then both made to feel uncomfortable.

Worse still is the 3rd and FINAL appointment that made me and my boyfriend SO UNCOMFORTABLE that we left and never returned, which I believe for legal reasons I do not want to state on yelp, but for personal reasons is important to me that I state that young women should be weary of this business, seriously stay away. 

This place also puts you through a strange series of tests from a bullshit computer program, where this man tells you you need an array of supplements - that you can purchase from him, or using a 'special promotion code' of his name at checkout (aka he gets a portion of the sales, aka scamming you for more money by scaring you about your health with a bullshit test).  

BAD BUSINESS DO NOT GO HERE.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------

ORIGINAL REVIEW:
I had a review up from a one-time groupon experience and am now changing it after I continued to come here for weekly chiropractic adjustments for the last two weeks (two adjustments)...

I was made to feel very uncomfortable. By the man that claims to be a doctor here.  I would not suggest this business.  Full review to come after I cancel my 'wellness membership.' 

A VERY UNPROFESSIONAL EXPERIENCE.  I DO NOT RECOMMEND."
765,"So, I went here today for a Groupon for a 60 minute massage.  Misty was my massage therapist. I had booked a chiropractor appointment, not part of the Groupon, directly after it on the phone with Dr. Parker.  So the massage today was good, and Misty was really nice and did some great work.  The first thing I noticed is that the table was very uncomfortable. Details matter...they just do in massage. I used to be a massage therapist and I regularly get many done. Having a table that isn't comfortable or that doesn't have a heating pad really isn't good for a massage practice. The table has a hole in it near the head. This makes it awkward for females lying prone on the table. No heating pad makes it more uncomfortable and is just a nicety that makes this ""warm and fuzzy"".  For music, she played Pandora..which I'm a fan of...but it has commercials...commercials aren't relaxing...so I just asked for silence instead. No biggie :)  However it seems like she isn't really supported by the chiropractor. I felt kind of bad for her in her situation.  The little things matter in massage, at least to me..people will come back.

What the most disappointing this for me in this visit, was that Dr. Parker hadn't shown up for the chiropractor appointment. No call or text. He had made the appointment with me personally and yet didn't show up for it. Apparently he wasn't going to be in at all today and had 3 clients after me. This is unacceptable to me and unprofessional. I wouldn't  recommend this place based of that alone. He owns the practice. Not of this was the massage therapist's fault.  It is unfortunate is all. I try and be patient and compassionate, but I really was looking forward to an adjustment..and have been looking for a new chiropractor...and was really disappointed to just have him not show up.  I would been more understanding if he had contacted me first thing this morning...or even last night... but to just not show up.  I've not had that happen before."
766,"I was referred to Dr. Ward by Dr. Sears who wrote that he thought I was a Schizophrenic? 
(I don't know at the time-my attorney told me later) Dr. Wards was extremely unpleasant and made me feel very Uncomfortable. I had to ask a friend to come to the doctor w/me. 
                          Please note the definition of Schizophrenic.
""Schizophrenia is a chronic and severe mental disorder that affects how a person thinks, feels, and behaves. People with schizophrenia may seem like they have lost touch with reality.""
                                 Wow-I would stay away from this place!"
767,"In a nutshell, this is a HORRIBLE place for any patient who isn't  comfortable being seen by other patients and their accompanying family members while wearing nothing but a hospital gown, underwear and socks. 

The details (and for the sake of clarity this will be wordy), but let me start out by saying that the staff was FINE, I have zero complaints about ANYONE on staff. It's their process that horrified me. 

I have to have periodic MRIs of my brain, so after having had several of them, I was well aware that it's VITAL not to have even a speck of metal on or in my body when going into a massive magnet. I totally get that, not a problem. 

The first few times I went though this exam, I was first ASKED both in writing and orally whether I was wearing any metal or had any piercings or implants of any kind, etc., and of course not being an idiot I answered accurately that I didn't have anything like that, and they trusted my answer. As a disabled (and now elderly) person, I wear loose, usually knit clothing that I can get on and take off easily, never any zippers or buttons. I was always allowed to go through the MRI in my regular, soft, non-metal clothes. 

Well I guess experience & maybe litigation taught them not to trust patients to answer that question accurately anymore, so now in addition to being asked repeatedly about the presence of any metal, one is now required to undress and wear a gown during the procedure anyway. Also, not a problem, I totally get it. Even if they're just scanning your head as in my case, you can't wear anything you came in wearing except your underwear and socks, so you don one of their hospital gowns. You are also provided with a pair of (non-stretchy) scrub pants, IF you can get into them (and fit into them), but they didn't fit me so I just asked for a second gown so I could wear one opening frontward and the other opening backward. No problem. Disability is about nothing so much as adapting.

(My son, a computer tech, asked me later why they don't just have a metal detector at the door of the room, which I thought was a good question but I didn't ask them.)

So once I was safely dressed (or barely half-dressed), I was escorted in my underpants, socks and gowns from the changing booth to another waiting room, where I had to sit and wait with other half-dressed patients (male and female), along with the family members who accompanied them. That was an awkward, really uncomfortable situation for me and for some others; ALL the obese people were bottomless, and there was a very elderly woman there sitting across from me, also in a gown, looking very obviously embarrassed, trying to cover her bra-less, gown-covered chest with her arms. I tried to ignore the whole situation and just breath deeply and chill out, it was VERY uncomfortable. 

When my name was called, I was immediately relieved that not only was my waiting time over, but I'd FINALLY be entering a truly PRIVATE room where only healthcare professionals would be looking at me...or so I THOUGHT! But nope, no such luck.

First, I was stunned to learn that I wouldn't be allowed to take my walker into the room, even briefly, just until I could get to the edge of the scanning table, I guess because on some level the magnet part is always running or might go on unexpectedly, so I was forced to leave my walker outside of the room (!) and walk unaided across a long (for a disabled person who can barely walk at all) expanse of linoleum floor while only wearing slippery socks on my feet, which is INSANELY dangerous for disabled elderly anyway, but I took my time and didn't fall, thank goodness. I can't imagine what they do with people who cannot possibly walk a single step at all. I guess they just don't get MRIs. 

After I managed to get safely to the scanning table, things only got worse. The door to the MRI room, which was more or less beyond the foot of the table, was still WIDE open and I could still be clearly seen by patients sitting outside the room, so I still had an audience as I struggled awkwardly to climb onto the table and gradually get into the position they needed for my scan. Because I get muscle spasms in my legs whenever I try to lie flat on my back, I asked for ""the wedge' (a giant pillow-type thing) to be put under my legs; maybe they use that for everyone. When I was holding my legs up in the air at their request as the tech gradually positioned the wedge, I knew I was practically mooning the old guy outside the door who hadn't taken his eyes off me.  

(I'd been the HIPAA compliance officer for the family practice where I'd worked, and I was realizing that there's nothing in HIPAA re: PHYSICAL privacy. It's just about privacy of medical RECORDS, not your actual body.) 

I resolved then and there to NEVER to put myself through that humiliation again.  No more MRIs for me, as least never from ARA."
768,"I would agree with other reviews here. The hygienist and receptionist were very nice, kind, knowledgeable, ect... Then they told me I needed 3 fillings. 2 weeks later I'm still in horrible pain, have jagged fillings, and am looking for a second opinion. The Dr was 30 mins late to my appt. When she arrived she said she just lives down the road... She drilled me and left me in the chair for 30, yes 30 mins. My Novocain wore off. When I told her, she told me that I was fine repeatedly. She came back to fill the drilled holes in my teeth, and proceeded to watch TV while trying to fill them! I would close my mouth when she was watching TV, and she would get upset with me, almost shouting, ""open your mouth wider!"" I was lying in the chair crying from anxiety and pain while she kept telling me I was fine. The dentist was rude to the other employees as well, shouting at them while working on my teeth. That made me very uncomfortable. I am just so disappointed. I really should have heeded some warnings on this page prior to letting them do my fillings. I am certainly paying now, with time, pain, and money to have this fixed. I will NEVER go back. This was the worst dental experience I have ever had. This is the first negative yelp review I've written because I haven't had an experience I have felt this way about prior."
769,"I was in the market for a new naturopath, and I was excited to see Dr. Lasse. I received a call the day of my appointment and the receptionist informed me that she was sick and since she would want to give me 100% care, gave me the option to reschedule. After thinking about it, I decided to go ahead with the appointment because the timing was right for me. As I waited in the lobby, I could see her in her office reading my chart, which felt awkward. She then invited me in, and went into the lobby to look over my chart. I could hear her talking to someone in the lobby. She came back in and said someone kept talking to her so she couldn't ready my chart. Um, make a boundary? That didn't strike me as demonstrating strength of character. So we started our session without her reading my chart.
      She told me that she offered to reschedule because she was concerned about getting ME sick, which was a different story the receptionist painted. Throughout our session, I felt very uncomfortable. It was very awkward. The way she looked at me felt like she was reading into every little move I made or word I said. I understand that there is information in body language and word choice, though I felt she was over doing it in a very obvious way. She did not have expertise in the area I was seeing her for, and she gave me a recommendation for a naturopath that I do like and I am grateful for that.
       Since she was sick, I am sure that she was not operating at her best and in hindsight, I should have rescheduled. However, I feel that once again I was duped by the 5 star ratings. While I am sure she does good work and is a good fit for some, she was not a good fit for me.
      It is not easy to find exceptional health practitioners these days!"
770,"My overall experience was somewhat great with a few serious issues. Please know that my review is honest. I am not and angry nor bitter patient that's here to smear a business. I'm here sharing my experience and the frustrating aspects of it to ensure that future patients can avoid it. 

Surgery: I had all four of my wisdom teeth removed and my SURGICAL experience was great. 

Dr. Zakir Shaikh was professional. Before he surgery, he explained  X-Ray, the problem I had and solution quickly like most doctors do. He briefly went over the surgery, what was going to happen, what to avoid etc. He left probably trusting that the rest of information would be properly explained by his nurses. 

I had no issues with the surgical aspect of my visit. I was put to sleep quickly. When I woke up and afterwards, I experience very slight soreness and major numbness on my lower face and tongue. I was consistent, however, with my pain medications and post op care. 

PROBLEM: 

While the general staff and nurses had a pleasant demeanor; apparently the nurses that attended to me weren't use to people wanting to know the details of their service, prescriptions and post op care and were very nonchalant about important details. 

They were extremely vague and did NOT professionally explain certain things. 

For example, I was prescribed very strong pain relievers and then told to take a high dose of ibuprofen. When they were asked about how I should take the medications: together, interchangeably, etc.

I was told: Oh you just have to take them both but spaced out time wise. 

When I asked why, the answer was: that's just what we do. 

What does that even mean??

Fortunately for me, I come from a family filled with significantly educated medical professionals. Afterward my surgery, I contacted an aunt to get this explanation: 

""For the narcotic pain meds and the over the counter meds, u need to stagger ur doses. So, if u take the narcotic at 8am when u start to feel a little bit of pain, take the Ibuprofen. This will extend the time between u needing to take the narcotic again. And this allows for you to ween urself off the narcotics."" 


Why couldn't they have just said that? Why was everything so vague? It made me very uncomfortable. I found my aftercare instructions to be more detail on google than what the nurse, that I had the ""pleasure"" of dealing with, explained to me in person. 

When approached about certain details not being properly mentioned, they made excuses and said that it was on a paper given to me and I probably missed it due to the amount of information I was getting all at once. 

How is that possible if you're here being vague and hasty? Then, when I went to cross check to ensure that was the case about the info being on the paperwork given and it wasn't. 

Also, when we were leaving, a nurse gave my family member a prescription (the medication itself) without saying anything. No instructions nothing. I called the same day post op and the day after to get some clarity. It was as if it was a fight to get anyone to give me a proper answer. I finally got into contact with a well educated nurse only to be told that the medication was for office use ONLY and was not suppose to have been given to a patient to leave with to begin with.  

This over all expectations makes worried about other medical offices because this establishment is considered the best place to seek medical attention. 

So all in all, I wasn't ambushed with rude attitudes or customer service. My surgery was indeed great without complications and I experienced little to no pain so far. My issues were concerning the nurses and the way they handled questions, and details. As a patient, I wasn't trying to be difficult. 

I was polite the entire time, and was simply trying to be educated on the service being provided to me. They seem to need to learn how to separate their fatigue or impatience or whatever they have going on personally. These nurses need to take their jobs and patients seriously to ensure that they are seen as educated and well trained professionals. They also need cover all the necessary bases in detail to avoid being the reasons for post op mistakes, like a patient overdosing, due to VAGUE communication and actually be useful. 

Please be mindful, ask questions, do not take things for face value because vague instructions and info, can cause you to ultimately hurt yourself, implicate your aftercare or surgery and these same nurses will then tell you that it's YOUR fault and not take on any of the liability they ultimately were responsible for."
771,"I usually go to the Copley office for blood draws, but I'm a tough stick and the one woman there who could stick me without trouble was transferred. When I heard this I was worried about finding someone else in the practice who might be able to handle my tricky veins without leaving me in pain or with a big bruise. I don't have a problem with needles, but when someone has to fish around in both your arms it can get very uncomfortable. Especially when you need blood drawn as often as I do. I decided to try the Medford office and told them in the lab that I'm tricky. The woman at the front desk relayed this information and Marilyn in the lab volunteered to draw my blood with confidence. She got it painlessly on the first try - it was my best needle stick in a while! The fact of the matter is, some people just have a knack for sticking those hard-to-find veins and I really appreciated that the front desk took my comment seriously and didn't just brush me off and give me to whoever. Yes, drawing blood is everyone's job in the lab, but that doesn't mean some people don't have more experience with annoying veins than others. I'll be back to see Marilyn again for sure!"
772,"please check all reviews on all sites for this non-surgical center pham is a fraud not a cs. he has a lawsuit against him in chicago & several pending in orlando if we can save one person from this monster, we have done our job!!unprofessional staff here. the wait times are awful & the price quotes always seem to change when you arrive. the services for facials & peels is in a freezing cold room shared with another person! very uncomfortable. my surgery experiences were absolutely horrible as i was botched twice, got an infection & pham refused to fix it without extra money being paid. the owner, hanu is non-responsive to clients & only cares about the dollars & nonsense. do not go to this center. there are better services in winter haven. the other thing that made me uncomfortable is that the staff are trained not to trust clients. they big you about paying for services up front. when they screw up they do not offer to fix it. i am so disappointed in this center. save your money and go to miami if you're looking for results. bs!! do not trust this guy or the response! they are dishonest and if they screw you up... don't expect help. here's what to expect: phone calls ignored, complaints unanswered, no refunds ever offered-just ask someone he's screwed over besides me & my friends-look at reviews on all review sites, there is a woman that won't even go outside because he botched her face it's permanently swollen and uneven, this is a cold hearted guy nathan fake pham. all they want is money. this guy has a maid that he pays $800 a week off the backs of those he has swindled. be aware-don't go there"
773,"I went here for the first time as they were covered under my insurance and my current doctor isn't. When I called, they scheduled me with someone who wasn't the doctor covered, but said it was the same as seeing him and billed under him.

When I got there, I had to wait almost four hours just to even SEE a doctor, then was pretty much immediately told I needed to come back and see the doctor I had called to make an appointment for in the first place 2 weeks ago. 

The staff was nice, but the doctor I saw made me feel very uncomfortable. I'd rather be broke and see a doctor not under my insurance then waste money being passed around from doctor to doctor here."
774,"I personally drive all the way to Alpharetta because I trust all the doctors working in this facility. I've had my first pregnancy at this facility as well and I was very impressed with how organized and great the team was.  My first pregnancy was high risk (gestational, preclampsia) and it was a difficult pregnancy but they doctors were extremely knowledgeable and definitely 'knew what they were doing' which is why I chose the same facility again for the second time. 

Only issue I have with this facility is the one racist front desk person who is sort of racist and very unfriendly towards the Asian patients. What annoys me is that SHE too is a person of color yet she only shows kindness and friendliness towards the WHITE patients.  Today when I had walked into the front desk, this racist front desk person DID not even acknowledge that I was standing in front of her and completely ignored me. It was very uncomfortable. Right after me, there was a white patient and she immediately got off the phone (or she was still on the phone i can't remember) and she starts kissing her ass. And she was super friendly to ALL of the other white patients after me except towards another Asian patient. 

But whatever, I have a great job with a great health insurance, and I am still going to give 5 stars to this facility because the doctors and the nurses are AWESOME."
775,"I had a great first experience with Klein. I was having a breakout on my chest that wasn't going away and was making me very uncomfortable. Since I have never been to Klein previously they were able to get me seen within 2 days of calling. -- what a plus! Didn't have to wait 3+ weeks! 

Lisa Peters was great, enjoyed her bubbly personality and how she made the appointment easy  going and comfortable. She prescribed me a different cream to try. This cream so far has been affective. 

I am grateful for being seen so quickly. The office is very clean which I appreciate as I am a nurse and aware of all the ""creepy crawlies"" being everywhere. I appreciated the staff for how pleasant they were, oh and the paperwork didn't take forever to complete. That was nice. 

I am interested in going back to the clinic and learning about other services that are provided. 

Thanks!"
776,"I went in because it's closer to my house everything was fine my insurance co pay was $100 which wasn't a problem, I was told that's all I had to pay then a year later I check credit karma and they are charging me $930 when I called customer service I was told that's the physicians bill and they charge separate. I was not told I'd have to pay anything besides my co pay when I was signing out this place is running scams do not go here"
777,"What can I say? It's a dentists office, who loves the dentist?

I came here for a consultation on my wisdom teeth since they were giving me no end of problems. I went in for the consultation, got it checked out, then had to come back again for a surgical consultation. That was annoying. But once I got that consult since my teeth were pretty straightforward I got an appointment for the next Monday to get all four out. I had to work in the morning so I didn't set my appointment till 1pm. They're very strict on the fact that you can't eat or drink anything before the surgery, not even water, so by the time 1pm rolled around, I was ready to be over and done with it all. My mom met me so she could drive me home (they won't start the procedure unless someone is in the waiting room the whole time). So we checked in and waited....and waited....and waited..... For two freaking hours. At this point, I'm starving and parched because I can't swallow water, my mom is trying to coordinate with my dad to see if he can wait at the office now because she's going to be late for an appointment (because they said block out 2 hours). I did t get back to the chair till almost 3:30pm. I was livid. I didn't get in the car to go home until 4:30pm. 

The plus side? the original quote of $500 after insurance dropped to $220. No idea why, but whatever, I'll take anything at this point."
778,"What can I say? Gorgeous, calming facility, sauna, great staff. Root's also probably the place with the most consistently outstanding classes and instructors around...and if you knew me, you'd know how much that's saying (I am a total exercise junkie and teach, myself). Props to Shaney and Jay, especially.  I've yet to take the Muay Thai or Nia classes, but am looking forward to both"
779,"We have been going here for years.... Way back when it used to be acrossed the street! I have brought both of my kids here since they were little, and my husband is a patient as well. We always get our needs met and our healthcare is taken very seriously. If it is a complicated issue then they make a referral and it gets set up and the place referred typically calls or we do, and they are expecting the call. We have never had ANY problems with this office! I must also add that my insurance recently changed and it has been a hassle literally everywhere we have gone, and even worse, getting our scripts switched over has been a nightmare... The insurance company, for being as established as they are, has not ceased in surprising me in just how much they DON'T have their sh*t together! They were fighting paying for every prescription we have and it was taking so long, as every time I would call to find out what the problem was, the buck would get passed and my call transferred out to someone else, just to start all over again w/ a person who doesn't know what they are doing. I was truly exasperated and got a hold of Columbia medical themselves as this prior auth was taking weeks & nothing heard back from the insurance end and my daughter was almost to the point of being off her much MUCH needed medications. I talked to Jordan at CMC and she jumped right into the situation and made several call backs to the insurance company to get answers. Hey, what can I say? I was far too upset and stressed out to have said anything nice, much less professional! 
So Jordan jumped right into the saddle and man did she make things happen! I am SO grateful... We FINALLY got the medication approved and brought home. 
HUGE THANK YOU TO YOU JORDAN!!! The world is a better place because of people like you! :)"
780,"The waiting room boasts a tabletop arcade game for kids, complete with children-sized chairs, and you can bet your ass that it's where I sit when I'm there, and yes, I do play the games. It's next to the outlet, so it's perfect for iPhone charging. What can I say?

The staff are nice, and I survived my first ""deep cleaning"" with help from their generously juiced laughing gas and a powerful massage chair. They do offer free bleaching trays with cleaning, so now it won't just be my skin that's blinding people. All in all a good experience, and my other friends that go there say the same."
781,"Because I would always want someone else to give me the nitty-gritty truth, I will deliver no less. I purposely waited MONTHS before posting this; equally for the anonymity and the PTSD from my experience.

 The staff was friendly enough but very, very casual. I read one review that referred to them as ""rough around the edges"". I would disagree based on my interactions, but I can understand the interpretation.  From the waiting room, you can see the checkout staff surfing on social media. No judgment here. IG is life to some, so to each their own.
  
The cleaning:
Holy...crap. It was THE MOST PAINFUL CLEANING OF MY ENTIRE LIFE! (I know what you're thinking: ""Oh, perhaps you don't floss"", or ""You must have a low pain threshold"", or think I'm being dramatic. Nah. Nope. NO!  I have a pretty high pain tolerance and nearly perfect teeth according to all past dentists (a trained eye can tell that they could use my perfect arch in medical journals *Wink*). Never had a cavity in my life, floss daily; never had or needed braces. Just blessed in that area, I guess. What can I say? But, I digress...

The first hygienist I had was very nice. No complaints there.
...However...
FOR THE LOVE OF GOD, why would someone so sweet stab, prod, poke, and puncture my gums with such intensity??? I don't know! It was as if she has a personal vendetta against my gum line! I tried to power through it and reminded myself of more painful experiences to gain perspective (like a fractured thumb, bad knee... childbirth), all in vain. It hurt like a MOFO! I don't understand why. No other hygenist has ever in my life made me cry and I'm a full-grown, adult human. My previous office gave excellent cleanings for many years and it was never, ever that painful. It was absolutely awful! I thought I may pass out. I WANTED to pass out! Unfortunately, I did not. Instead, I laid there trembling, waiting for her to notice the pooling of the tears rolling down my face or for a referee to throw a flag for unnecessary roughness. Sadly, neither happened. Was I atoning for something I did to her in a past life? I seriously cringe at the memory of the pain. Smh.

 The dentist eventually came in, didn't say too much; nothing memorable (or perhaps my soul just already left my body after that cleaning and so wasn't present enough to actually process anything said).

The second appointment was for my child and they had a different hygienist.

Honestly, the whole experience was as comical as it was concerning:

The hygenist was nice enough (for reference: rather short, short brown hair, glasses) but...we couldn't tell if she was nervous because it was her first day (or maybe even frazzled because it was her last day...) but her behavior made both me and my child literally uneasy. From the moment she entered the room, she was all over the place and oddly frantic. I typically don't mind going to the dentist, but I imagine those who get nervous just by being there would not ever want the hygienist to act more nervous than they are.

One moment she was sitting. The next, standing... The entire appointment was filled with sporadic shifts: she was sitting, she was standing, she left the room, she came back, she talked to colleagues, she moved things around, she went to the computer, she came back, she was here, she was there, she was in the drawers, she was back to me, she was gone again ...She was literally all...over...the...place.  This would not have been an issue, but it was amplified because she somehow chattered mindlessly the ENTIRE TIME. She was saying actual words, but couldn't stay on one topic.
 
She talked and she talked and she talked and she talked and she talked and she talked and she talked and she talked and she talked and she talked and she talked and she talked and she talked and she and she talked and talked and she talked and she talked and she talked and she talked and she talked and she talked and she talked... and then, guess what? She talked some more! 

She talked to me, to my kid, to colleagues; to anything that moved. I can't explain it. Just trust me: I would never mention something so silly unless it was significant, and this truly was! I would have understood if it was just typical small chat and superficial ""getting to know you"" questions or even just to explain what she was doing at the time to put the patient at ease. But no. It was mindless, frantic, nervous, uncontrolled chatter. The. Entire. Time! Her nervousness was so noticeable and outlandish that I worried something was wrong.  I honestly couldn't tell if we were witnessing something that should have been addressed immediately or not. I'm not joking.  Again, I am truly not trying to be rude or mean, because she was nice, but it made us truly uncomfortable.  I do apologize if she was new, or perhaps dealing with personal mental health issues, but it was just so offputting that I would be remiss not to mention it.

So, yeah, we won't be back, but to each their own."
782,"Everyone here is sincerely interested in making you comfortable, and providing great service.  I've got dentist anxiety (it makes me annoyed when they call it a phobia - it's not a phobia, there isn't anything to be afraid of, it's just anxiety), and they know it and they try really hard to make sure I'm not freaked out.  Friendly, ready to make small talk to distract me, comfortable environment.  

My cleaning was real quick, and the tech was a peach.  She is interesting and quirky, my kind of geeky.  She really knows her stuff and I feel like I'm in good hands.  I've got a filling replacement I keep putting off and they haven't given me any grief about it.  I guess they know I'll do it when I'm ready.   I appreciate the space and non-judgy acceptance.  

I'm a delicate flower, what can I say?"
783,"As good as it gets! I have been living with a bulged disc for 17 years now and for anyone that knows what that is it can be a living hell. I've tried injections and other forms of treatments to no avail. As soon as the drugs wore off I was back to being my old miserable self. I have even been recommended for surgery as a last resort, which I have flatly refused. 

About 4 years ago my mom's neighbor watched as I gingerly tried getting out of my pick-up one day while visiting. Long story short, after learning from my mom what was ailing me on that day (flare up) she suggested for me to visit Dr. Lawson. She's been a patient of Dr. Lawson for 12 years (same condition).

I set up my first appointment with Dr. Lawson's professional staff soon thereafter. I have to admit that though I was a bit leery of what I considered ""alternative"" medicine I had nothing to lose since I was tired of using tons of injections and medication to mask my pain. After a very thorough evaluation consisting of question and answer paperwork as well as a one on one personal interview by Dr. Lawson himself I received my first treatment. 

I can honestly say that I no longer receive injections or take expensive prescription ""knock me on my butt"" medication for my condition. I visit Dr. Lawson about about once a month for preventive treatment or what he calls pain management and occasionally in between after an especially strenuous workout. I manage to keep most of my occasional pain under control with over the counter meds. 

I plan on continuing visiting Dr. Lawson as long as I need to. He has honestly been the reason why I will rule out surgery. As for the negative review, what can I say? 1 or 2 out of thousands of patients is not a bad ratio. I would recommend Dr. Lawson at Lawson Chiropractic to anyone that is tired of suffering from this or other similar conditions. 

Thank you Dr. Lawson!"
784,"What can I say? Boudoir photography is boudoir photography.  What makes Vivian's Muse awesome is Julia, the photographer.  She makes a potentially UNCOMFORTABLE experience an awesome, natural, exciting one.  I am generally a reserved person but this has always been something I thought would be fun.  For multiple reasons, I took the ""jump"" this summer and couldn't be happier.  You don't have to worry about looking great.  Julia keeps an eye out for your best angles/shots while making you feel beautiful and talking you through/calming you down the whole thing.  If you've ever considered a boudoir photoshoot, I'd definitely recommend calling Julia."
785,"What can I say? If you absolutely hate your tattoo and you want it gone for whatever reason, Rob and Disappearing inc. are the people to see. Rob takes the proper steps to make the procedure as less painful as possible. Rob is very swift and precise with the laser machine, he gets you in and out in no time, and the results are incredibly noticeable. I highly recommend this professional institution for the removal of your tattoos or having it lighten to a point that your tattoo artist can cover it in the future."
786,"What can I say? They got me in quickly, they helped me get my appointments for other testing, and scheduled my endoscopy for the very next day! I used to see Dr. Ruderman here, but now since he has retired, I'm seeing Dr. Zhu. She's an excellent doctor and was so compassionate, kind, and easy to talk to. The staff are friendly, efficient and helpful. I have other friends who see other physicians at this practice and they are very happy with the care they have received. If you need a colonoscopy, Endoscopy or any other gut-related help, you need to see these folks!.
  Follow up: the folks in the surgery center are amazing!  Helen is the sweetest and most caring and compassionate person I've ever met in a medical facility!  The rest of the staff were wonderful-sincere, HAPPILY caring for all of us who were patients there for testing!  

Trust your gut to CDH!"

788,"Way to go Dr. Mosier!  Dr. Mosier was highly recommended to me by several professionals in the health industry.  I had a failed breast reconstruction due to infection post mastectomy.  Meaning I had implants, removal of implants, etc.  After 3 major sugeries in 6 months and multiple months of treatment of numerous antibiotics I was at my wits end.  

Dr. Mosier successfullly gave me tissues expanders in one operation and replaced those with permanent implants in another operation removing the cadaver skin that caused the infections in the first place.  

What can I say?  Fantastic bedside manner, smart friendly nurses and staff, and A++ technical and creative skill in my breast reconstruction.  I look and feel great thanks to Dr. Mosier.  HIghly recommended!"
789,"I started going here 9 years ago after a 9 year dental hiatus from pure fear. These guys are nice and patient with impatient patients. I used to see Dr. Jradeh - 2 root canals, and now, unfortunately, Dr. Shapiro has done 3 more. What can I say? Irish teeth. Anyway, they treat nervous patients kindly, seem to give a damn, and are only judgmental about things that they should be. Sometimes we need some shaming. 

The prices are fair - although paying for 2 root canals in 1.5 months mostly out of pocket has left me poorer. That's not Gentle Dental's fault. They've worked with me for some coupons. 

Give them a try."
790,"After being a patient of Dr. Patel for well over 2 years, it's time for me to write a review.  What can I say?  Dr. Patel is wonderful!  I really appreciate how ""hi-tech"" his equipment is --- which I believe is critical when going to the dentist and keeping up in our tech savvy city.  You even get to pick your own Pandora station during your checkup!  

Appointments start are on time and you're never left waiting for another patient to finish up.  Also, I've never felt that Dr. Patel has ever tried to upsell me, which unfortunately has happened one too many times in the past with other dentists.  He lets you know what work (if anything outside of a cleaning) is needed and has a gentle hand to complete the work. 

I would highly recommend this office!  Added bonus, they have a convenient S. Congress location. :)"
791,"Some time ago, when we didn't find a nearby dentist we liked, we ventured beyond our neighborhood into Monroe Dental in Milwaukie. What can I say? I couldn't be happier. Initially, I was just glad to read others' good reviews and to learn that Dr. Goh accepts our insurance. I booked our entire family for dental visits. The receptionist went out of her way to find a block of time where we can all be seen at the same time, practically. Each of us was pleased with Dr. Goh and her staff, and for different reasons. 

My child enjoys the caring and gentle manner of Dr. Goh and her assistant (I wish I could remember her name, sorry!). My partner has commented about her competence and common sense approach. Dr. Goh tells it like it is. She is well apprised of updates in her field, and differentiates between what's trendy and what's good. We receive top-notch dental and periodontal care with no scare tactics (you know what I'm talking about, we've all been to those dentists!). I love the atmosphere in the dental office. It is not stuffy and somehow feels homey. The small waiting room feels cosy, not small. The huge stuffed animals look so comfortable in their chair, right next to us. I feel comfortable waiting, if it is not my turn. When I am in the dental chair, I love the view from the window.

So today, in spite of the distance, we keep on returning to see Dr. Goh for maintenance and to receive occasional care. I would not dream of looking elsewhere."
792,"They are life savers! What can I say? My husband's fake tooth fell off on a Friday, and after speaking with several dentists with the help of my experienced MIL, we found Dr. Powell and Dr. Tiller. They asked the correct questions and were honest and upfront. They are not in the network of my husband's insurance but their exceptional customer service and confidence made us stick with them. On Monday at noon my husband was happy again, chewing with his reattached tooth ;)  Thank you!"
793,What can I say? The staff at Mesa dental from the techs to the doctors are all superb. My first visit was so impressive that I will definitely make this my home for all my dental needs going forward. The techs so impressive upfront. Very cheerful and very welcoming. I was having trouble with the x-ray plates in my mouth and they were so patient and kind and we got through thanks to their excellent attitudes and patience. My consultation with the dentist was very effective and she helped me establish a good treatment plan for my dental issues going forward. I think what impressed me the most was her concern about my oral health. This is a very good Dentist's office and I am very pleased. I'm a fan
794,"What can I say? Look at the bad reviews. The Dr. is  great, but that office management staff is inept and negligent. I don't like to provide negative reviews, unless all resources to resolve the problem have been exhausted but folks need to understand that doing your job poorly will negatively impact people's lives. I understand Dr. Girardot needs to able to focus on attending his patients, but he needs to be held accountable for his billing manager's gross negligence and complete lack of respect for people's financial well-being. I'll update with links to my BBB and if available, my DBPR complaint as well. We'll miss Dr Giradot, but he'll need to fix his staffing problems before we ever return."
795,"Sigh.  What can I say?  She is a bona fide R. N. / aesthetician /product developer who is constantly demonstrating curiosity and a thirst for knowledge.  She maintains currency in her field by attending conferences, and conducting her own research as well as furthering a more formal education.  She offers a wide variety of services and never makes you feel uncomfortable with an awkward upsell or P T Barnum huckstering of products.  It's all about you and your fabulous self.  And baby, you will look fantastic under her care."
796,"First time ever getting a foot massage for an hour. It was $30. 
What can I say? This place looks nice inside and not sketch. 
It was labor day weekend when I visited and it was packed!
The massage part was relaxing. It was different at first, but I definitely enjoyed it.
I really want to try their full-body massage soon so I'll definitely be back."
797,"I moved to Portland about a year ago and haven't found a doctor here that I liked...until I went here.  Let's face it--finding a doctor is like finding a salon.  Except that if you have hurting body parts, it's a bit more serious than getting a bad haircut.

I needed to see a doctor so I called this place on a recommendation from a friend and was able to get a same-day appointment.  I didn't have any specific doctor in mind, but they set me up with Dr. Seres.  

What can I say?  This was the best doctor experience that I've ever had.  And I've seen a lot of doctors in my day.  Dr. Seres' experience and knowledge is definitely quite apparent, but he's not cocky about it like most doctors I've found.  Being female, I've preferred female physicians in the past, but I found him very easy to talk to and I felt comfortable discussing my health with him.  He was very honest and upfront.  But most of all, he was super friendly.

Not to mention that the body is one big mystery for those of us who aren't in the medical field.  I needed to have a CT scan.  Immediately following that, he brought me back in and discussed everything with me....showing me how it is read and how everything functions.  I can't express how important this was to me.  If something is hurting, it's good to know why...and even better when we can SEE why.

Needless to say, I've finally found my Portland physician.  The only downside about this place is the long wait times, as mentioned by others.  I can understand why.  But I'd rather wait and have a thorough exam."
798,"What can I say? Well let me begin by telling  you how lucky we are to have Dr Rajani here in Portland Oregon. Top notch are the first words that come to mind! Having lived in other large metropolitan cities, it would be worth traveling here just  to have him work his magic! As popular as facial aesthetics are, I still find it important to to be able to rely on someone with the knowledge and skills that Dr. Rajani offers.

Style Aesthetics located in the Pearl District. It is discreet, with no awkward waiting room.  All of the staff that I've met there are so friendly and kind! I first had a meeting with Alexa, his beautiful and polite office manager. We talked about my desires and she helped me define my goals. (She has been so wonderful over these past few years!).  Having had botox and fillers in the past, I wanted an honest opinion for what would be the biggest bang for the buck. When I met with Dr. Rajani, he proposed Sculptra, which I had never had heard of before.  I left the office the first time with a ""Have to think about it, that's kinda steep, just don't know"". After a few weeks and some research, I came back and I'm glad I did. I am now a Sculptra Girl! I have come to appreciate the subtle changes and overall improvement it has given my face. Having had fillers in the past that fade quickly with my metabolism, Sculptra gets better over time. He was exactly right when he told me to be patient and not expect instant results on my first visit. Sculptra seems to get better with each treatment. It's been about two years and I just had Sculptra  done one week ago, and this time the results were instant! The injections in my temples lifted my eyes so I look more like the old ME! I am over the moon with the results! Nothing artificial looking about it. It just gives you a more overall youthful look. Dr. Rajani has also used Radiesse on my jawline for more definition.  I am anxious to try more things as the budget  allows.
 
Yep, so great to have such a skilled professional like Dr. Rajani right here in Portland Oregon...Lucky us!"
799,"Gees, it's happening again. I really hate it when I have to be the first one to break the 5-star thread here. But I am upset at my experience with the Seton Northwest Hospital's ER, and I feel it is beneficial for others to read my observations.

My wife got sick very suddenly, the whole day she was feeling well but around 5 PM she felt a strong fever & chills (her entire body was shaking) and a terrible headache. We measured her temperature- oops, 102 degrees. She felt so miserable that we had no choice but to bring her to the Seton ER room (after reading so many recommendations on Yelp... plus it is like 7-8 minutes away from our house, so convenient).

We got there around 7:00 PM tonight- Sunday the 11th of October. We got cold reception, filled the usual paperwork, then we were directed to a ""special"" medium size waiting room that was so full of people, my wife took the last seat. She felt really sick, shivering, barely able to stand up. Doesn't matter, took them 4 1/2 hours to see her. She just sent me an SMS a few minutes ago, the doctor finally was able to examine her, and yes she got the flu... A heavy form of it. My wife told me that after the doctor saw her, she was left to ""wait for the prescription"" and she was really sick, shaking with terrible fever. Another 30 minutes later, finally somebody showed up, and when they saw her, they got ""very worried"" and gave her a Motrin to lower the 102.5 F fever... Very cool...

Well what can I say? At least she saw the doctor... At least she got the prescription drug- and thank God she is young and strong. I imagine if it was another person, with more health problems... Would that person survive the wait here?

To the other Yelpers who wrote reviews: you guys were very lucky to get such a short wait here- in our case, it was a record (long & tedious) wait. Even in larger US cities where I've lived before, I never had to wait as long as that..."
800,What can I say?  My face not only wears a smile but my feet do also. What a great dr. Not only does he show compassion  but he actually listens to you and carefully explains everything. Thank you dr. Isiorho and I look forward to my next visit.  Joanna di meglio
801,"I've had an awesome experience with Dr. Whitfield who is such a warm, caring, and just an all around beautiful individual that takes great pride in his work as well as the well being of his patients.  What can I say???  I had two botched up procedures following a bilateral mastectomy with another plastic surgeon  before I came to see you and I suffered quite a bit down the road with the implants.  I wish I would have been more thorough with my research when being referred but fast forward to meeting you Dr Whitfield and my diep flap surgery in April 2018.  I can't say enough about my first encounter with you and your beautiful staff i love you all.   I'm very grateful to have Dr. Whitfield as my plastic surgeon and couldn't get any better.  

Dr. Whitfield is patient, understanding, and not only cares about the outcome of his work but those he serve as well.  Dr. Whitfield exceeded my expectations and I'm extremely pleased with the results of my surgery and looking forward to my next procedure.  I highly recommend Dr. Whitfield to anyone considering plastic surgery because Dr. Whitfield is the best in Austin period. 

I'm humbled and grateful to you and your staff for taking such good care of me and always being there.  Thank you so very much.  

P.S.  The staff at the surgical center were fantastic as well.  Can't say enough about the crew except they were amazing. 

Peacefully, 
Andrea W."
802,"Well, what can I say?  Sometimes I'm not too bright.  

After my fun trip to Tucson, AZ, I came back from there with a broken foot.  Well, I didn't exactly know that at the time but, alas after about three weeks and the bruises were gone and the pain was not I decided that I should have someone other than my co-workers, look at my foot.

At first I called my regular podiatrist, yes, I have a regular one, I'm just that clumsy (did I mention I tried tap dancing too? But I digress).  My regular podiatrist was out of town and not expected back for a couple of weeks well, I've already pushed the envelope on this so I asked his office for a few names.  The first one they gave me was Dr. Mark Hastings.  He like my other podiatrist, is a one man show so they tend to trade clients back and forth.

I was pleasantly surprised that his office was nearby and he was able to get me in for an appointment soon.

When we first met, he said, ""Hi, I'm Dr. Hastings,"" and I said,  ""Pleased to meet you, I'm a dumb ass.""  He said, "" No one has ever introduced themselves like that before.""  I said,""Well, probably when you hear the story of how I broke my foot you'll agree.""

I go on to explain that while I'm at the ball park in Arizona my bf decided to walk across the seats to get to our seats.  I decided to follow him.

This was my first error as this is not something I would normally do but alas, caught in the heat of the moment I decided to follow. 

Well, I made the mistake that probably others have and stepped back on the chair (hey, I'm new at this give me a break) and of course fell through.  Well, I was ok at that point, nothing broken  but what I did next sealed it.  I tried to get up by pushing on the seat down, oops stupid adrenaline, my feet are still in the chair.  So, with a little help from by bf and the neighboring people I got out of the chair.

So, Dr. Hastings, said, What did they say at urgent care?""  I said ,Urgent care?  He said, ""Didn't you see someone at urgent care?""  I said, ""No, I'm seeing you now three weeks later.""

Well, he took x-rays and it was indeed broken and after much trouble with some of the boots he issued me a boot and I was on my way.

Dr. Hastings made a bad situation much better.  Very nice and easy to work with.  He's also a great sports fan so if you have a chance take a look at the huge Portland Trail Blazer shoes in the front display.  Very cool.

Hopefully, I won't do something as crazy as this again but if I do I know where to go."
803,"It's a gynecologist office...what can I say?  It's not fun to go...

But the check-in is convenient, the staff is nice and friendly and I love my doc...Dr. Julie Jones, she is super cool and very easy to talk to.

My only complaint would be to have more evening hours but I'll work around it."
804,"What can I say? They are stabbing me with a needle and taking my blood. They analyze it and send it to my doctor. Sometime there is a long wait, half hour. Sometimes I get there early and I am the first one. So far so good."
805,"Wish I had seen these reviews before going to my appointment. What can I say?? Pushy, Cocky, doesn't bother to look at the five page new patient information packet that I filled out, waited an hour and twenty minutes. Insist on a urine test before being prescribed meds???"
806,"What can I say? Because of Dr. Moghadam and his amazing staff, I'm 24 weeks pregnant with our first baby boy and could not be more thrilled. We highly recommend AFI. 

To sum it up, we went to Dr. M in late January when, after failed attempts with drugs, my OB Dr. Mushtaler (who I also really like) said IVF was likely our only option. She said there were some other fertility clinics in town but she worked with him the most and thought I would like that, like hers, his practice was smaller. She also said every woman she had ever sent to him for IUI or IVF came back pregnant. We couldn't argue with that!

We set up a consultation, and it went much differently than I was expecting. He wasn't at all the dry, all-business doctor I had expected. Even though he must have that same initial conversation with couples everyday, he explained our options in a way that didn't feel rehearsed. We liked that he was so thorough in walking us through the process but was also very down to earth and straight-forward with us. We are very lucky to have insurance that covered almost everything so we did not have to discuss pricing, which I know is a deciding factor for many couples. 

We got started right away, and by late March I had my egg retrieval. You're in there a LOT during this time, with weekly or daily visits, so we got to know the nurses pretty well and loved them all. Dr. M is a busy guy, and we did a lot of waiting, so bring something to do! I can see how this is frustrating to people, but we understood that with the nature of his practice he couldn't control how many procedures he might have pop up in one day (pushing back his regular office appointments) and knew that when the time came for ours we would get his full attention too. And of course, we did. 

I want to mention that everything was not easy breezy for us, and because of a condition I have I ended up in the hospital for five days after the retrieval. It was not fun. It really sucked. But it was something we think Dr. M and staff could not have avoided, as we were well-warned of this risk beforehand. Dr. M was very easy to get ahold of during that time, answering calls and texts day or night, and then coming by the hospital everyday and spending quite a bit of time with us for updates and to answer any questions. (It delayed the embryo transfer, but come June I finally got that BFP...we were pregnant!) I say this to emphasize that even after going through that we still highly recommend AFI and will be back when we're ready for baby number two!

Thank you to Dr. Moghadam and everyone at AFI for giving us our son, who we can't wait for you to meet in February!"
807,"What can I say? I jammed my toes and it's only few days away from my departure to my destination wedding. Called Friday morning and got an urgent first time appt same day in the afternoon. Dr. Finn is probably the best chiropractor I have found in the States. He checked me from top to bottom and everything he said was right on. Not only he show me exercise I can do at home for maintenance, what surprised me is that he offer to come in on Sunday if I need another adjustment before I leave on Monday.  This IS what I called customer service. Now I am hooked and will be a long time customer. If you need a chiropractor I would suggest give Dr. Finn a try first before going else where."
808,"What can I say? We have been patients there since 2002 I was recommended by a coworker whose kids were already well into their 20's; We had the blessing to have Dr. David Ruiz as our pediatrician, then he retired when I had my second child He was so awesome, old fashion and cool and he spoke Spanish and was down to earth doc I wish he comes back. Now on my 4th child and even thought we live in Pflugerville, we find the trip there worth it. I just wish they'd accept Medic Aid so I can recommend my clients at WIC. Great staff, love them!"
809,"Dr. Miller has been my orthodontist for a little over a year, in that time seen SUCH a big improvement in my smile. Besides the cosmetic benefits of straight teeth, a crossbite put a few of my teeth at risk for fracturing later in life, so the health long-term benefits of sooner-than-later orthodontic care are more important than most people realize. I have lingual braces (braces on the back of your teeth) and they are a really tricky way to adhere braces, and in ADDITION to the technique being difficult, I break inordinately more brackets off of my teeth than most orthodontic patients normally could if they used their mouth like an *actual* circular saw for nacho eating (I live life on the edge, I guess, what can I say?). My visits are always SO quick, completely and entirely without discomfort, and Dr. Miller only compliments his devastating good looks with the etiquette and charm not to criticize my shortcomings in personal orthodontic care. If it weren't for Dr. Miller, I would probably be terrified of this kind of work. 

The best part about lingual braces, is that you don't have to take them in and out like Invisalign; Therefore you are less likely to lose them or decide not to wear them for a few hours- and NO ONE KNOWS! I can honestly say that I already have a smile that I never dreamed of, and receive compliments on weekly."
810,"I have been to this facility for almost three years. Teeth cleanings have been fine, but I had two bad experience of teeth filling with Dr Russ recently. In August or September 2018, I was told that three neighboring teeth had cavities that needed to be filled, and that the filling of three teeth needs two visits.  It took over two months to get the appointment. I had the first filling with one teeth in November 2018. This filling cost $309 after insurance. I booked the 2nd appointment on the day when the first filling was done, and was told the first available is  almost three months later. OK, I took it. Over the waiting period, I can feel the cavity got bigger and worse. I got the 2nd filling on the other two teeth in March 2019.This filling cost $481 after insurance. I was told the anesthetic will go away by noon, but it did not till dinner time.
After the filling, I did not feel any improvement on my cavity. I believe she did some work (on the crown of the teeth), but I just can't feel it. However, what I can feel is that the big gap between my the molar and premolar does not change, and it catches food every time I chew on this side. As a result, I cannot use the molars this side. So I called the office, was told to wait for a few days to see if it got better. I followed the instruction. It did not, so I called them again, was told to go to the office. A nurse checked my teeth, telling me it looks perfect. Later Dr Russ told me the same thing. Excuse me? How come I can't use them if they are perfect?

Then I go back to home. Did not mention it again, until I had my next cleaning in March. I told the nursing who cleaned my teeth that I cannot chew on these molars, because there is a big gap and it catches food every time I use them. Dr Russ came, telling me she can try to do it again, but she cannot guarantee it would be successful. The nurse reassured me that she is gonna fix it. Yes, they used the word ""fix"". So I made the next appointment. It is not available until May, that's another two months waiting. I double checked over the phone if this is gonna be charged. They said ""No, it is a fix"". 

For some reason on my part, this appointment was rescheduled to the afternoon of August 5. She spent about 10 minutes on me. She inserted a wedge in the gap (which actually made the it bigger), and used some more materials to fill it. After she was done, I asked : ""what did you do just now? "" She replied: ""Mary (the assistant) will let you know"" and left. I asked Mary, she went ""She fixed the gap"". I asked for the pictures, and they were shown to me at my request. The after looks worse than the before, and my tongue and eating experience are consistent with the pictures. I did not say anything and left, very disappointed. What can I say? She has tried, for free.

Two weeks later, I received a bill regarding this so-called ""fix"". I called the office, the recipient told me it was not a fix, but a separate treatment. I told her that I confirmed that it would be free when scheduling the appointment. The administrative manager returned the call and asked me to disregard the bill. He also mentioned that he saw my 1 star review on rateabiz, and ""reminded"" me of what I have written. But I cannot see my own review on that website. The worst review on rateabiz for this business is a 3 star review. How interesting. Is it true that the 1 star review is only visible to business owner, not the public?

If you only need teeth cleaning and smiling faces, then yes this is a fine place. If your teeth need treatment, you may want to re-evaluate her proficiency and the long waiting time. She is definitely taking more patients than she can handle."
811,"These folks know how to do their job and make you feel awesome while doing it, goo all over your abdomen aside.

I arrived late: it's the T, what are you going to do? (I know, leave earlier; I know for the next time), and the receptionists were accommodating and not-too-annoyed. During my short wait (less than 10 mins.), I was able to entertain myself watching House Hunters on the ginormous TV and eating the complimentary Lindor chocolates.

My techs were warm, friendly, helpful, even though my kid was really not cooperating (they needed him to roll over, he wouldn't; what can I say? He get it from his mama!). They put me at ease, totally. Then, when the doctor arrived to give it one more shot to get a different angle, she, too, was kind and funny and awesome. And she answers your millions of questions without getting annoyed or vexed.

And hey, I left with some great pics to put on my fridge. Yay!

Overall: top-notch, professional service, chocolates and your first round of baby pics."
812,What can I say?!!! Wow!! What an unexpected experience. I went to an appointment at the digestive healthcare. I ended up in the hospital and had to have surgery; as I have never In my life been admitted in the hospital. I can truly say the experience here was a great one!!! The team of doctors and staff really took GREAT care of me. They are compassionate and are good at what they do. Thanks a bunch!!! Piedmont Hospital. I am on the road to recovery!!!!!! Dr. Jagiella at digestive healthcare you are truly a God sent!! Thank you so much for your compassionate soul!!!! You took great care of me and made sure I got the help I needed..
813,"My wife and I have both been seeing Karen for more than 2 years now. She's not big (Olympic gymnasts usually aren't) but don't let that fool you - she knows just how to position your body and hers to use the pounds she has to maximum effect. I need a good bone cracking on a regular basis and Karen delivers. A big part of her effectiveness with me comes from my complete trust in her. I don't subconsciously fight her by holding tension in whatever part she is manipulating and that yields much better results. A standard adjustment is immediately preceded by a session with a licensed massage therapist who concentrates on your problem area - makes a lot of sense to me that removing tension results in an easier, more effective adjustment.

Everyone in her office is a joy to be around. Oh, and if you are one who prefers ""gentle"" chiropractic methods (you're missing out, but what can I say?), I have no doubt that Karen can deliver that as well."
814,"What can I say?  From the moment we walked in, we were welcomed by the staff and Dr. Maki herself.  Our need was something fairly simple but did require attention.  We were seen right away ,exam was done, medication was administered right there to get the ball rolling, and then receiving a prescription to take to the pharmacy.  But it goes WAY  beyond that!!  We were chatting like they've known us forever.  Not your typical visit to the doctors office.  On a Saturday afternoon.  At 2pm.  I'd like to keep them to myself but honestly-I've been to other Urgent Care Centers and have not been treated this well.  Dr. Maki's knowledge base goes far beyond most.  Add that to her easy-going personality-lets just say, I will NEVER go anywhere else.  They have the state of the art equipment, x-ray, lab, EKG just to name a few.  If you need them, I would advise you to check them out!!!  You won't be sorry :-)"
815,"Okay, so I've known  Dr. Ramirez for a few years, but I never wrote a review before. What can I say? Professional doctor and professional staff to say the least. He always gave me the impression that he really cared for me as a patient and as a human being. I had an implant done with him which can be very scary!! (plus I didn't want to be put to sleep during the procedure) and Dr. Ramirez was phenomenal- making jokes with the intention to make me feel at ease and it worked. Dr. Ramirez is also a very gentle person and has a friendly personality. Sam was also great! Anyways, just wanted to say kuddos to them for making such a great team."
816,"Dr. Grayman: wow! What can I say? Let me quote Oprah, ""She is ... the mother I never had. She is ... the sister everybody would want. She is the friend that everybody deserves. I don't know a better person. I don't know a better person."" If you think that's extreme then you definitely didn't see my face before. I sometimes even forget because I'm so used to having nice skin now. I recently travelled to attend a wedding and friends and family who hadn't seen me in years complimented my skin non-sto"

818,I can't say enough about Dr. Rich and Sohalia and the rest of the group. I honestly look forward to going to the dentist! I hope they never retire.
819,"So far 2 out of 2 doctors I saw were downright scary.

First doctor - It's fine that she studied medicine in another country, but it's not fine that when taking my family medical history she had never heard of a fairly common disease (stated by me in both the common term and the technical medical term) I mentioned. Then, she wrote the wrong prescription - good thing I researched it first - and the pharmacy acted like they were doing me a favor by accepting it back in exchange for what she ""meant to"" select from the drop down menu on the computer instead - sorry, that's very, very scary and not excusable. Lastly was the puzzling form letter I got that addressed an issue I had but was completely not particular to me (in fact, it was the opposite as I found out when I called asking ""you want me to do what?! and was told ""oops"").

So, next time I picked a different doctor. She was younger than me (that strikes me as funny that I'm old enough for that...) and had to rely on her pocket pc to answer very basic questions when I, not a doctor, (correctly) questioned an explanation she'd made that was clearly inaccurate in my particular case. Sure enough, her pocket pc agreed with me, not her. Scary.

The nurse practitioners I've seen have been pretty decent. The lab people themselves have been fine (even the phlebotomists have been good to needle-phobic me). Even the billing folks have been nice and helpful. The building is nice. Medical records are kept on the computer, so that's cool and also lets you access online. So that all gains one star. The other star is because at least I have insurance that pays for most stuff, so I'm grateful.

Without much choice, I'll go back and cross my fingers I find a better doc there. In any case, I will continue to always research any information or prescriptions they give me. But I shouldn't have to."
820,"My experience with MIT medical in the past year has been a complete nightmare. Before I go into the details I must point out that I actually really like my primary care physician at MIT Medical and have only positive things to say about her. However, MIT pediatrics, Urgent Care, and pharmacy have been just awful. First, MIT urgent care prescribed incorrect dosage of medicine for my son and I only realized it because my son was prescribed the same medicine before. After the medicine problem was corrected, I was short 15ml of the medicine and MIT pharmacy refused to give me the medicine. Second, a doctor at MIT pediatrics misdiagnosed appendicitis as constipation even though I kept saying it could be appendicitis, resulting in complications that landed my son in the hospital twice. I filed a complain and as a result they are now overreacting. Just yesterday, my son's primary care physician freaked out and asked me to take my son to the ER over the phone when it was not warranted. I told her it could be strep throat but she refused to listen and threatened me by saying she would still ask me to take him to the ER anyway if I wait to have her examine him no matter the outcome of her exam.  After multiple hours of waiting in the ER and unnecessary tests and ultrasound, the diagnosis was indeed strep throat. So basically she wasted my time and my money ($100 ER copay vs. $10 at MIT medical) as well as thousands of dollars of insurer's money."
821,"I had my first appointment with Dr.Cunningham. Her staff does it great job ensuring patients are coming and going at different times so that you are socially distanced. All staff members wore mask and I checked in from my car. Looking at the treatment room and reception area, they were completely spotless. I waited in the treatment room for about two minutes before Dr.Cunningham entered. I found the doctor to be very personable and extremely knowledgeable about the skin and skin conditions. She explained everything that she was going to do before she did it. I felt completely comfortable in her care. I definitely recommend Dr.Cunningham for all your skincare needs."
822,"I have been seeing Dr Marks for 3 years now. We've had our trial and error procedures, until we found a procedure that works. 

I've had the opportunity multiple times to switch procedures to my neurologist instead of Dr. Marks but I've stuck with Dr. Marks for the convenience of his south location and also Jill in scheduling/billing. Dealing with a third party pharmacy is literally HELL and every 3 months Jill and I have communication to ensure the pharmacy gets my prescription delivered on time. 

There are been plenty of hiccups I've encountered with scheduling, billing and the actual procedure itself but I've stuck through with no complaint because as a doctor, Dr. Marks listens to your concerns.

Now, I have found out that Dr. Marks' office will no longer accept my insurance. 

I am upset and stressed because I find out two days ago via mail with no prior warning that on August 2 it will not be accepted.
I get it, stuff like this happens but not typically in a week from when that letter was dated. 

I have to do a procedure every 3 months and dealing with the pharmacy to switch takes about 3 months to get insurance coverage, billing etc sent to my new doctor- 
I was due for my appointment at the end of this month. 

So thanks...
I know it's not Dr. Marks fault - insurance company's do this all the time but seriously, this communication didn't even come from Diagnostic Pain Center- not even a warning.

You'd think after 3 years of being a patient I'd be more than just a ""number"" to the practice."
823,"I wish I could rate my experience even lower. I saw 2 pediatric doctors at this center neither doctor could explain why my child was experiencing partial vision loss. Where is it acceptable to tell someone they can't help you, have no idea what's wrong but then you're expected to pay them for quickly glancing at the same results that should have been researched and analyzed ahead of my visit? Or at least have the decency of guiding one in the right direction to a solution, if you are so stumped by his condition. The receptionists and nurses have no business dealing with pediatrics and neither do the doctors (there are so few neuro-ophtalmologists in the area that we are at their mercy) I was told to wait 2 months to see the neuro- ophtalmologist (2 months to wait with a child that can't see and is experiencing debilitating headaches) then after insisting on getting in sooner I get in with a doctor that brushed us off. I had to request that he order an MRI then after the MRI I was simply advised to come back in 2 months ... For what are we all going to pray that my child's vision is restored ??? I was offered no guidance or alternative options .... They are horrible and I suggest you seek a specialist out of town if you care about your children.

My feedback to the doctor if you care act like it
I would like to see a plan of action and some concern as to how he's progressing 
I want a refund 2 doctors at this location no answers .... This is completely unacceptable... I know it doesn't work that way because some how we've accepted that doctors don't have to know what they are doing but you are specialists and this is your job. Act like it's important."
824,"I have a natural distrust of psychiatry due to my knowledge of political and corporate corruption and bias in the DSM and FDA. Far from ""checked out"" or ""dismissive"" - Dr. Sheehan has always treated me with respect and care, without any inappropriate attachment or being blinded by projection, as I have experienced with my mental health providers in the past. I feel heard, I feel respected, and most importantly, as a Borderline - I feel unable to manipulate Dr. Sheehan who remains serene, compassionate, cerebral - almost zen-like in his detached but kind approach to care. Through him, with all the bitter doubts and resentments in the world, I have finally found relief through a minimal and carefully monitored application of meds, along with the life-changing DBT Support Group at Seton Mind Institute. 

Lacking ego or attachment - this thoughtful and gentle young scientist has given me and my family hope and a positive outlook that we have not experienced in my entire life.

It's painful and difficult to live with the stigma of mental imbalance, but what is more soul-wrenching is the ripple effects it has upon my parents, sister, son and countless others. 

He has improved the life of not one, but a community of people.

In other words, the world thanks you for helping this craycray bitch out! LOL"
825,"I have not been a patient long but I have had several office visits. Dr Reddy seems nice and her staff (hygienists and assistants) seem kind and nice..I must say Sabrina is the greatest asset to this office.. She is extremely kind, warm, thorough, and knowledgeable. And she is all of these things under immense pressure. I have observed her doing 4 things at once and still keeping her composure. She should actually have her own school for those trying to advance the customer service skills.. So Creative Dentistry I give you a thumbs..Whatever you do keep Sabrina. She rocks!"
826,"My husband was referred to Dr. Klaiman after his GP noticed his creatinin level was very high and his doctor worried that he might be at risk for kidney failure.

Dr. Klaiman and his Nurse Practitioner Rushie Gandi Shaw took good care of him. They did a number of tests and quickly scheduled my husband in for prostrate surgery because he soon wasn't able to release anything from his bladder.

The surgery went well and soon my husband was back on his feet.

They regularly checked my husband's progress. When he had difficulties, they immediately got him in for a check up and provided a solution. When asked about pain from a catheter, Dr. Klaiman provided a prescription. 

The effect of the surgery was to alter the medications my husband was on--after surgery his blood pressure dropped.

Overall, the experience with Dr. Klaiman was very positive. Office waits were minimal.  Follow ups directly helped his situation. After surgery, when my husband was out still, Dr. Klaiman gave me an overview of what had occurred in surgery and what to expect next. He was back visiting my husband after 7pm which I thought miraculous."
827,"My daughter has hair down to her butt and when she brought home lice from school, I thought no big deal - right? WRONG! We tried shampoos, combs, electric combs, olive oil, and home remedies with no luck. Over 3 months of constantly returning lice. We brought her to the Lice Place and in ONE afternoon it was gone permanently with NO chemicals. Thank you LICE PLACE!"
828,"I went in to get a mole checked out, it was my first time to this clinic. They were running behind and had me wait in the patient room for over an hour. When Dr, Leddon arrived she came in, quickly glanced at my mole, said it was fine and removed her gloves in an instant. She asked me if that was all, while her hand was literally turning the door knob to leave. It flustered me and I got the message that I wouldn't be asking her to give me a whole body scan given I have had cancerous basal cells. I even told her nurse and yet not one of them offered to look. I was in a state of shock at how I waited over an hour, and she came into the room and spent no more than 90 seconds with me. By the way, no one even apologized for the wait. I have never had such a poor experience with a physician or medical group. I don't know how this woman is still employed, especially after reading these reviews. Oh and yes they constantly send robo calls. Seriously avoid this clinic, or at the very least avoid Dr. Leddon."
829,I'm honestly shocked at all the positive reviews. I thought this place was a scam like some of the other reviewers said. Not sure if she targets certain people? Be prepared to commit to paying $3000+ and go 3x a week for 3 months. I went to 2 appointments that were a sales pitch and received no treatment. It was a complete waste of time. The pressure Honi puts on you is insane..left crying. 9pm I get a TEXT from Honi saying sorry things didn't work out. It was super strange as I never said she could text me and I've never experienced anything like that with any doctor or my previous chiropractor. It didn't seem right and I'm glad I got out of there. I'll be going back to Marini Chiropractic Office - it's a little further of a drive but at least he never pushed me into treatment and never made me cry!
830,"If I could give this place a negative rating I would! This was the most horrible medical experience I've had in my life and this happened about 4 years ago. That's how traumatic the experience was. This place is ONLY ok if you would've had an easy pregnancy already. If you have any complications they are not in the correct mindset or qualified enough to support you. 

During my consultation and birth plan, in writing as well, I specifically stated if I was in labor and not dilating after 12 hours or so I was ok with an epidural. Fast forward to my labor. I had very bad back labor and once that happened no one knew how to truly help me with that. Back labor and regular labor are a horrid combo. By hour 15 with no further Dilation and no drugs I requested an epidural and told NO! The nurse Kept coming in placing the stethoscope on my stomach every other minute triggering even MORE contractions every single time. Nurse you have every wire hooked up and can read my baby as well. I am in excruciating pain and my body is exhausted please stop exacerbating an exhausted body THAT CANNOT BE GOOD FOR THE BABY. I began sobbing and crying at hour 20 with no drugs and no dilation. I began pleading for an epidural. They gave me something else that lasted about 45. I asked them to do it again they told me they can only administer it once! We'll get me the epidural I asked for. I told the midwife- well screaming and crying at the same time-that my body is stressed and I cannot have the baby with my body stress levels this way I needed the epidural to have the baby! You would think a midwife would respect the moms wishes correct? Absolutely not, she did just as a doctor would and ignored me. By hour 22, after screaming and crying so the whole floor could hear me and no progression, my mom demanded they give me an epidural and could not understand why ""you're letting her suffer like this"". So she reluctantly called the anesthesiologist. Guess what, only one on staff for THE ENTIRE HOSPITAL! He was in surgery for two more hours. Hour 24, the anesthesiologist took one look at me and I could see the sorrow on this mans face. I could tell he felt so bad for me. After the epidural, literally I fully dilated in 30 minutes and pushed the baby out in the last 30 min. Just like I told the midwife!

I won't even go into the rest of the awfulness after my beautiful baby was born. Let's just say no one told me I was supposed to take ibuprofen or Advil for pain after childbirth so I had no clue my body wasn't supposed to be hurting like this UNTIL THE PEDIATRICIAN TOLD ME I NEEDED SOMETHING days later when she saw I was in pain.

Thankfully I have my beautiful baby and I'm a generally healthy person. So I made it through. I cringe to imagine what would've happened if I had any underlying health conditions I wasn't aware of! 

Between Atlanta medical and intown, if you have complications you are putting your health and your babies health at risk. Mothers beware!"
831,"the best. these physicians are all quite different -but that allows you to choose the right fit. we ended up with Dr Baine - she was on call when the preemie twins arrived. She is bright, articulate, patient and truly engages and connects with even her infant patients. she takes all the time needed to address everything and is very incredibly supportive of the parent. her MA/Nurse Kristi is AWESOME ! and we hope she never leaves. we've seen several other partners for sick visits and always get treated well by all staff- they treat us as though we're the only patients they have."
832,"I was pregnant and gave birth at Duval during the 2013 year. I was initially with my OB/GYN, who I love, but didn't like the idea of a hospital & was looking for something that felt more ""homey"". I mostly chose this place because I wanted to be with people that had the same ideals as me, so I wouldn't  have to worry about making a birth plan or trying to advocate for myself while dealing with labor. I transferred to AABC right in the middle of my pregnancy.

As a first time mom, during the initial tour, I came prepared with all kinds of questions from the internet. Most were answered well enough, but some of my questions were shrugged off & midwife even told me ""you worry too much"" haha..okay..?  When I asked ""what percentage of your clients end up needing to go to a hospital"" she couldn't really answer. I asked the admin about that and if they had other statistics. She said they didn't really do numbers like that, but they could get back with me. They never did.

They have informative classes by a doula about the birth process, which was nice. There was also a class about how to breast feed, but I feel that one was very fast, less organized and overall not very helpful. 

After giving birth, I had a very helpful lactation consultant attempt to show me how to breastfeed. I had called AABC again for help and the South Austin LC was on call. She was less helpful. It seemed like she didn't want to drive up to see me and minimized my issue, ""sometimes babies just cry."" I felt hesitant to ask for any assistance after that. I actually ended up having a huge problem, my supply tanked and my baby's weight went under the 3rd percentile. I know they say their LCs are available to you, but I kept getting the feeling that I should only be calling them once or twice max. If I have to find another LC 2 days after giving birth, I'm not sure what the point is of choosing this place. It doesn't seem like a perk anymore if I still have to find someone else. 

Like I said, I transferred in the middle of my pregnancy. I really didn't have any mom friends or know what I was doing, so I requested to join their ""centering"" group, which is when you meet periodically with all the women that are due around the same time and supposed to be available to everyone who gives birth at AABC. The midwives and one administrator told me I could, but whenever I'd ask, the scheduler would only say that I was too late and I couldn't join. I'm sure it was partly the hormones, but I was really excited to meet with other ladies and envisioned future baby play dates! but not joining made me feel like one of those kids that gets left out in gym class. I felt alone, for sure.

You get whichever midwife is on call for that time. They attempt to make appointments with all of them, so by the time you give birth, you'll feel comfortable. However, if you end up with someone you're not comfortable with, tough luck.

I called my midwife in the middle of the night when I felt my contractions getting shorter and regular. I understand it sucks to be woken up, but it seemed like she really didn't want me to come in. I had to have my husband call her a second time and she finally agreed. When we arrived, she smelled so strongly of smoke that I didn't even want to practice breathing with her because it stunk. I was initially thrilled to get her, as she was the most experienced & can do ""baby spinning"" (big plus) but those two things were kind of off-putting. 

Also, she had attempted to do a knee reflex thing when I arrived, but it didn't work. She said ""perfect, everything's great"". As someone who is already on edge from never giving birth before, it made me nervous, because if you fib about a stupid knee reflex, what else won't you say? After that, during pushing, she'd say to push & I won't tear, but I had a twinge of doubt, which is obviously not good when you're trying to eject a baby from your body!

I gave birth vaginally and without medication. I was exhausted! I feel the 8 hours to be a bit too short. Instead of resting, the midwife's assistant let me have a quick nap, then kept coming in to have us do paperwork, wash the baby, get me walking, etc. Everything was quick, quick, quick. Before we knew it, the 8 hours was up. I understand this isn't a facility for me to stay overnight or anything, but I think maybe 12 hours from birth time would be more helpful. I felt very rushed with 8 hours.

Seeing everything in a list looks horrible! It wasn't a terrible place. It was a lovely, intimate setting to give birth in, but I was extremely doubtful of their abilities to care for me in case of an emergency. I agreed to go with them because they were maybe 5-10 min away from the hospital.

I liked that this place was cheaper and had the same birthing ideals as me, but I  don't think I'd go here again. I was worried that I'd be too tired or in pain to advocate for myself in a hospital setting, but I wasn't. I'd likely either do a home birth or go back to my OB/GYN."
833,"Honestly the worst experience I've ever had at an urgent care. The MA named Christiana was unprofessional, as well as the fact that she dropped my culture tube lid on the floor and put it back in the tube when she picked it up. There couldn't be germs on the floor that could mess that up now could there? She kept calling me baby. Which although I don't mind, is not professional. When I went to the front desk to check in. The receptionist told me they hadn't scanned my insurance ethics year. Even though I've been to this location multiple times this year, guess they hadn't done their job previously this first half of 2017. The doctor is phenomenal but that MA was the worst."
834,"Im so pissed.. i should have checked yelp first...Now I see why there are so many one stars.. Ok, last Saturday my temp crown fell off.. So I'm rushing around tryin to find a dentist on Saturday.. So I googled, an it gave me this place.. I called an they let me come in.. So I fill out paperwork, an the clerk says ""we need $276 to exam u"", I said.. All I need is some temp cement to fix cap.. An I can email u my recent X-rays.. Why the $276?? I got.. ""Well.. That's what we charge for new patients"", I said I understand.. But my X-rays shud suffice, an she said let me ask.. The tall man-ish lookin girl behind her said .. It doesn't matter.. We need the money.. I said so.. There are dozens of offices out here that give new clients free or low cost if they don't have X-rays.. An ur charging me $276?? They had no answer.. An they were not even remotely courteous, rude an condescending .. It was a horrid experience.. Please... Don't waste your time or money getting bamboozled by this ""dental"" office... Smh hard!!!"
835,"I can recommend FusionSleep but only with the caveat that you be vigilant about knowing ahead of time what your out of pocket expenses will be and consider buying your CPAP elsewhere.  I received a CPAP machine from them for mild apnea and while they did tell me there would be a significant up front charge to cover what my insurance didn't, I had no idea that I would also be getting a $50 bill every month until the 13 month rent to own period was up.  These machines cost thousands of dollars and they must be the bread and butter of their business.  What's worse is that mine hasn't really helped and there is no way to try before you buy.  If your sleep apnea isn't really bad I would recommend finding some other way to try one out before you buy it.  The machine I have, the ResMed Airsense 10, can be bought outright online for $700 to $800 which is less than half of what FusionSleep is charging me and my insurance.  Even with help from your insurance you'll probably end up paying more for the machine through FusionSleep.  If you buy it elsewhere at least you can sell it if it doesn't work for you.  I'm giving up in the middle of this 13 month rental and have to give them the machine back to avoid the monthly charges without recouping any of my investment.  

They are also aggressive about selling you recurring supplies for your machine that you don't really need such as hoses, masks, water tanks, and filters.  They are quick to tell you that you might as well take advantage because insurance will pay for them but they are not so quick to tell you that you'll still have to pay a significant portion.  The prices on these ""supplies"" are also excessive.

But hey, the staff is very friendly and Dr. Rhiney is smart, charming, and easy to talk to.  As others have noted, they are strict about the appointment times so allow yourself some time for traffic.  This is likely because Dr. Rhiney likes to give her patients plenty of time to discuss their issues which is great.  Double check with FusionSleep and your insurance about what your real costs will be and consider alternative sources for products and you'll probably have a good experience there."
836,"I was pregnant and gave birth at Duval during the 2013 year. I was initially with my OB/GYN, who I love, but didn't like the idea of a hospital & was looking for something that felt more ""homey"". I mostly chose this place because I wanted to be with people that had the same ideals as me, so I wouldn't  have to worry about making a birth plan or trying to advocate for myself while dealing with labor. I transferred to AABC right in the middle of my pregnancy.

As a first time mom, during the initial tour, I came prepared with all kinds of questions from the internet. Most were answered well enough, but some of my questions were shrugged off & midwife even told me ""you worry too much"" haha..okay..?  When I asked ""what percentage of your clients end up needing to go to a hospital"" she couldn't really answer. I asked the admin about that and if they had other statistics. She said they didn't really do numbers like that, but they could get back with me. They never did.

They have informative classes by a doula about the birth process, which was nice. There was also a class about how to breast feed, but I feel that one was very fast, less organized and overall not very helpful. 

After giving birth, I had a very helpful lactation consultant attempt to show me how to breastfeed. I had called AABC again for help and the South Austin LC was on call. She was less helpful. It seemed like she didn't want to drive up to see me and minimized my issue, ""sometimes babies just cry."" I felt hesitant to ask for any assistance after that. I actually ended up having a huge problem, my supply tanked and my baby's weight went under the 3rd percentile. I know they say their LCs are available to you, but I kept getting the feeling that I should only be calling them once or twice max. If I have to find another LC 2 days after giving birth, I'm not sure what the point is of choosing this place. It doesn't seem like a perk anymore if I still have to find someone else. 

Like I said, I transferred in the middle of my pregnancy. I really didn't have any mom friends or know what I was doing, so I requested to join their ""centering"" group, which is when you meet periodically with all the women that are due around the same time and supposed to be available to everyone who gives birth at AABC. The midwives and one administrator told me I could, but whenever I'd ask, the scheduler would only say that I was too late and I couldn't join. I'm sure it was partly the hormones, but I was really excited to meet with other ladies and envisioned future baby play dates! but not joining made me feel like one of those kids that gets left out in gym class. I felt alone, for sure.

You get whichever midwife is on call for that time. They attempt to make appointments with all of them, so by the time you give birth, you'll feel comfortable. However, if you end up with someone you're not comfortable with, tough luck.

I called my midwife in the middle of the night when I felt my contractions getting shorter and regular. I understand it sucks to be woken up, but it seemed like she really didn't want me to come in. I had to have my husband call her a second time and she finally agreed. When we arrived, she smelled so strongly of smoke that I didn't even want to practice breathing with her because it stunk. I was initially thrilled to get her, as she was the most experienced & can do ""baby spinning"" (big plus) but those two things were kind of off-putting. 

Also, she had attempted to do a knee reflex thing when I arrived, but it didn't work. She said ""perfect, everything's great"". As someone who is already on edge from never giving birth before, it made me nervous, because if you fib about a stupid knee reflex, what else won't you say? After that, during pushing, she'd say to push & I won't tear, but I had a twinge of doubt, which is obviously not good when you're trying to eject a baby from your body!

I gave birth vaginally and without medication. I was exhausted! I feel the 8 hours to be a bit too short. Instead of resting, the midwife's assistant let me have a quick nap, then kept coming in to have us do paperwork, wash the baby, get me walking, etc. Everything was quick, quick, quick. Before we knew it, the 8 hours was up. I understand this isn't a facility for me to stay overnight or anything, but I think maybe 12 hours from birth time would be more helpful. I felt very rushed with 8 hours.

Seeing everything in a list looks horrible! It wasn't a terrible place. It was a lovely, intimate setting to give birth in, but I was extremely doubtful of their abilities to care for me in case of an emergency. I agreed to go with them because they were maybe 5-10 min away from the hospital.

I liked that this place was cheaper and had the same birthing ideals as me, but I  don't think I'd go here again. I was worried that I'd be too tired or in pain to advocate for myself in a hospital setting, but I wasn't. I'd likely either do a home birth or go back to my OB/GYN."
837,"I was so very excited to visit this little crystal delight on my first visit to Mount Dora... but they were closed. I figured, just my bad timing right? Well on my second visit I made my tired friend stop again - closed at 2:00 in the afternoon. Boo, again sad but I thought maybe it was me. Okay, so 3rd time, at 1pm - closed. These visits were during the week. I saw something on the sign about crazy hours like 2:30pm - 5p? Now the Yelp listing does say differently, but that was not the case a few weeks ago. 

Not sure what's going on, but I was overjoyed to find a lovely little place that sells crystals and lovely things, but my heart was broken thrice. Next visit, if it is magically open, I will most certainly update my review for all you Yelpers. I'm not the type to give up."
838,This is crazy!  I called today to confirm my appointment for tomorrow and the number was disconnected.  So I looked on Yelp and surely it has closed down - with no notice or refund of prepaid services.  Is there anything the customers can do to get their money back?
839,I reached out to Breanna Howard at Skin by Lovely after finding out where she worked and after reading reviews for some skin care help. I'm so glad I did!!! The products have completely transformed my skin and I get compliments all the time on how perfect my skin looks. I'm obsessed with all the products I've been using but my favorites are absolutely the AH/HA exfoliating cleanser--my skin looks so refreshed after I use it and also the tinted moisturizer! The vitamin C serum rejuvenates my skin and the intensive moisturizer is my favorite night time treatment--it makes my skin feel so soft and smooth after I wake up every morning. I just can't say enough good things about the products and Breanna. She was such a doll and really took the time to explain the products and when and how to use each one for the best results.
840,"First and last visit to Sage Dental. Tried to bully me into unnecessary procedures and expenses. Sample of the conversation I recorded:
Me : ""I just want my teeth cleaned... a regular cleaning.""

Dentist: ""I don't know how corporate handles that. Go get the office manager.""

Receptionist: "" Unfortunately once we diagnose you, we are not allowed to do a simple cleaning. You must have a deep cleaning.""

Notice that ""corporate"" controls the policies; not the dentist.
Never going here again."
841,I wrote a review before and it was removed by yelp so I'd also like to add a rating for yelp here too which would be 1 star. Anyway I took my child here and paid over 200$ to have the doctor spend a couple of minutes finding nothing wrong with my child. Then I found out from friends that my child had croup (sp?). And after talking to a couple of others doctors this was correct. I told them I had taken my child to the doctor and what I had told the doctor at Oregon Pediatrics and they laughed and said they didn't know how a kids doctor would not know that. I wish I wouldn't have paid so much to an incompetent doctor to find out something that apparently is common knowledge to many parents.
842,"Christina Blatchford is hands down the best dentist I've ever had. I was actually a little offended reading some of these ridiculous reviews. I wasn't aware that calling a patient the next day to see how they're feeling is a marketing scheme? In my world that's called patient care, and it won huge points with me. Plus it IS your responsibility to know what your insurance covers, and you shouldn't have procedures done without checking first. 

After being treated by Dr. Blatchford for almost 3 years now, I wouldn't go anywhere else. She has given me exceptional dental care, including referring me to a great orthodontist for myself and my daughter. I was terrified when I first started getting dental work again because I knew I had a lot to complete. But from the start Dr. Blatchford was kind, professional, and goes above and beyond to make patients comfortable and keeps them pain free. She has personally called me after every procedure just to make sure I'm doing well. I've never had this experience before with a dentist or physician and it really makes you feel like you're not just another patient. 

Her staff is wonderful and every time I get a cleaning or routine check up they make me feel like I'm a part of their family. I would highly recommend Dr. Christina Blatchford and her staff."
843,"This is a continuous review of the previous one:

Final Chapter: Conclusions, Concerns, and questions
.
As I mentioned before, my rating for Boston Laser 90% of it is the result of the surgery. The service is not too bad but keep in mind that they have a lot of clients and staffs so you know how those clinic functions. Every time you go, you will have a different person helping you. That is why I said the staff in blue instead of the staff name. Some of them are assistants and some of them are doctors. The only way to tell the difference is to look at their name tag I suppose. Here are some facts and questions I can think of to help answer with my personal result. I had a minor halo during night times for first few weeks. I started experience eye dry after few weeks, strange isn't it. But it is just minor dryness. The most time I had minor dry eyes when waking up in the morning. Parking? They have meter street parking for max of two hours. Normally it is enough time to finish what you doing there unless you are late ofc. How much does it cost in Boston Lasik? I will say between 3k~7k base on what you have. The deciding factor will be insurance, referrals, student of some sort or some sort of third party with discount. For details please contact them. Oh and I don't have red eye until few days later with a minor red strip on my eyes, I guess I am pretty lucky! Or perhaps the god had answered my friends' prayers. Either way if you have any questions or concerns regarding Lasik or consider doing Lasik at Boston Lasik, feel free to message me. For a 100% most satisfy, I will say I am 96.79% satisfy from Boston Laser. That's a 5 stars right?
Last not least, why am I writing this long ass detailed story review? Well before I did the surgery I am the kind of person who wants to read as much material regarding Lasik as possible or to know as much as I can and now I've done it I want to help those who are consider doing Lasik but also scare of it like me out! I didn't put much of technical stuff here because you can find those elsewhere. I simply added my own experience here as much as I can think of right now and hope it will help some of you out there, I hope this helps and best of luck out there guys, peace!"
844,"Let me start by saying that I don't normally give a 5 star rating to any review, simply because everyone can improve. However, I have been going to Dr. Rifkin for the past 15 years and I have yet to find anything amiss with her practice. 15 years is a long time, and so I feel a 5 star rating at this point is well earned. I am not a ""fan"" of going to the dentist...as well, I am sure a lot of people aren't. But I would 'fly in' for her treatment from anywhere in the world. Literally, I would not even think of having any one else touch me for any major procedure. I have had a full set of 6 front caps (a bridge) replaced with her. I had the original ""installed"" when I was a mere 15 years old. Had that old thing in my mouth for about 30 years! The porcelain was wearing off, the gold underneath was showing through. Other dentist in the past (when I lived elsewhere) were dying to work on me...change it out etc. I never felt comfortable with any dentists to let them ""tamper"" with my mouth. Until Dr. Rifkin, and her caring staff. The new structure was put into place a few years ago and I have never had any concerns or troubles with it. It is a beautiful job, worthy of art, really. Totally looks natural and I know that it has made a huge difference in my professional perception of my. She now also does implants and is a full service, except for getting braces. 

The second major job she had to do for me was a baby tooth extraction. For some strange reason I had a baby tooth still on my lower right jaw without any other tooth underneath it throughout my adult life. It had never come loose, however it was slowly decaying. I finally decided to be done with it and have it taken out. Dr. Rifkin did the procedure herself (she does not delegate major jobs to anyone else) and her assistants were all quick and efficient and caring. One even held my hand! It was over before I knew it and never had any complications. My whole family uses her practice for years now. I look forward to many more years for wonderful service from her and her staff."
845,"I am not a doctor. my screen name is based on a character from the movie idiocracy.

To be fair to Dr. Nash, I have read his reviews online and he has more good reviews than bad.  I was a patient of Dr. Nash's for more than two years. He has a nice office and a professional staff.
 I start to look for a different dentist when my bad experiences outweigh my good ones.
 Unfortunately this is exactly what happened with Dr. Nash. He has done three crowns for me.
One of them went very well and I am quite happy with it. The second was satisfactory but something went wrong with the shaping and placement of the permanent. I now have a gap that constantly catches food.
 I understand that sometimes things go wrong in dentistry and that no dentist is perfect. My third crown was one such case.
It became infected after the temporary was placed. It was still very painful when Dr. Nash put the permanent on. In hind sight, I should never have allowed this to happen.  I should have insisted on waiting till the infection was completly gone before the permanant was placed. Perhaps Dr. Nash should have suggested this as well...
 It flared up again a year later and had to have a root canal done by an endodontist through the crown. Less than a year after that it began to bother me again. By this time I had reached that tipping point we talked about earlier. 
I gave Dr. Nash one more shot at it to be fair.  He said that the problem was with my bite. That was it.
I went to see a better dentist who removed the crown and showed me that it had been leaking for an undetermined amount of time and may have been leaking from the beginning. This made me wonder if all of my problems with this crown could be traced back to the permanent being placed while the tooth was still infected. I will never know. I have dental insurance which helped cover some of my expenses with the repair of this crown. However I stll ended up spending more than a thousand dollars of my own money to get this straightened out.

If you are searching for a dentist, do yourself a favor and read as many reviews as you can find. Put them all together and form your own opinion."
846,"When I finally got insurance last year I had to pick a provider, however there is no great way to find one who might, let's say think outside the box.  The bios on any doctor are vague at best.  I chose Rachel Delfavero I guess, like anyone picks a doc, by throwing a dart and hoping for the best.  

I saw her P.A in August as she herself wasn't available until December.  I liked the P.A. Crystal, but as I gave all my info, did blood work, I wasn't convinced that I had made the best decision.

I received my labs back through the portal and had multiple issues with it.  I eventually got them to mail me the paperwork.

I had an appt in Dec with the doc and we again did labs, since some were off from the first time. This time we had a discussion about the prescription and how I was feeling. I had seen a doc previously who understood my issues and was supportive, and I told her that he was willing to speak to her about my condition.  Apparently none of that took place and she told me to cut back on the meds, which then resulted in a huge spike in BP.  I told them after research, that that was not a good call.

At the December appt, I was charged $100 which I was unprepared for and later found out that the insurance company had covered what they had charged me.  By January, the check from insurance was sitting in someone's pile on the desk.  I had to contact the CEO to get my money back which took over 4 months!  I was pretty outraged at what the problem was.  Thankfully Lana Walker was a very  sweet and down to earth person, who understood my issue with the billing dept.

After I received my check finally, I had asked the doc for a sample of a prescription that was almost the same, except for lacking in the fillers from the same lab. I liked the sample, but after asking her to switch the script, I could not get an answer.  She agreed after multiple phone calls but would only approve a dosage that was almost half of what I'd been taking.  Multiple phone calls to her nurse explaining that it was the same drug, and needed the dosage to be the same... resulted in nothing but rebuttal.  I asked the pharmacy to call and explain, so they did, to no agreement.  I called the lab to ask that they also explain that it was the same drug and half the amount would not result in anything good for me, particularly after having high BP by dropping the dosage.  I again, called the CEO, but never was able to speak to her and voiced my concerns and problems with her assistant about Delfavero and why she couldn't understand the fact that the dosages should be the same.  

Fast forward to a month or so later, I just received a certified letter that I had to pick up at the post office stating that she was discontinuing our professional relationship, as if I wanted to have a personal one with her.

I called the lab of the drug company again, spoke to the person that had been helping me, and she said she eventually got to a nurse after multiple phone calls and being routed to wrong areas, that she explained that the drug was the same but would have to be equaled out to get the same dosage as the first one. I then told her that I was fired by the doc, for asking questions and trying to get the doc to understand the problem that she apparently didn't want to address. The person helping said she had never heard of that happening before.  Delfavero did no research, did not speak to the lab or the pharmacy and decided that I was a pain in her ass, so wouldn't help me anymore.  This is a doctor who has taken an oath to help people?

I am disgusted with this doctor and now the whole facility because it seems to be completely screwed up, but more importantly, there are lots of people willing to take money from patients, without helping them, when they truly need it.  And now am back to square one."
847,"I cannot recommend the staff and practices of Kwan Yin enough. I visited Dr Wilkinson for years, receiving the best health care of my entire life. If your insurance covers visits, go here and you'll never regret it. Read on for details.

I grew up with medical expertise in the family and hadn't ever been exposed to an alternative approach. When I was, I was entirely skeptical of it offering anything more than emotional reassure. I was incredibly wrong with what results are possible when a doctor cares for you using all available practices instead of a limited subset. Dr Wilkinson's deep knowledge of both eastern and western approaches help me trust her holistic approach. We went over everything from physical injuries to mental health and always connected me to excellent specialists. She also made time for me -- we spoke regularly and in detail about how I was doing, and adjusted her approach based on her knowing what I uniquely needed. I've never felt more comfortable with a doctor and more assured she was caring with me entirely, not just prescribing drugs and walking out the door. It's an incredible feeling that you desire to give a shot. Go visit."

Note to the Yelp review police: This reviews is similar to the one for Kwan Yin West, since I visited my doctor at both locations."
849,"I've been going to 2nd and Madison for around 5-6+ years. I love Cindy, her cowboy boots and the painting of the ""Bruja"" that hangs in the office. It's super convenient for me as it's close to work and I have recommended it to friends and family. Today I gave them a call because the temporary crown I had put on last Thursday fell out overnight. Avalon at the front desk informed me that Cindy was out of town for the week. I asked if anyone in the office could put it back on or if they had a suggestion for getting it fixed elsewhere and here is what she told me. She said I could go to the emergency dentist or I could always get established at another new dentist! I was legitimately floored. Last year was a busy year for my teeth and I ended up spending $8000 out of pocket in addition to what my dual insurance covered. Regardless, I was shocked that they would offer no remedy or back up plan beyond suggesting switching dentists or having an expensive emergent dental appointment.  
I was able to get in today at Kennedy Dental near my house and they were great! They didn't charge me a cent for the visit and were equally shocked at the lack of advice and empathy I received at the dental office I have been established at for over half a decade. 
I will be sharing this story far and wide with my colleagues at Moda/ODS and the other half a dozen folk my wife and I have referred to 2nd and Madison."
850,"I have had 4 appointments with this dentist, and I have some mixed reviews, this location for me was like having a brand new escalade with a engine, but needs some new tires, and sparkplugs.

I came on my first visit I was completely impressed by the atmosphere, they even have charges for your cell phone if you need it. I sat down in the lady kept asking me if I have insurance, I informed her that I did but she keep asking as if she didn't believe me. 

Then Kelly took very through x-rays and she knows how to put you at ease as if you are at Disney world. The people here are great, but some rough patches with communication. It was discovered that I needed a lot of work done, including a root canal, which I feared would be the case. So I set an appointment to get this done, but I set an earlier appointment to get the crown done, so that I wouldn't lose the filling I had from A previous time. So when I can to the appointment, the lady said okay, I understand we are doing a root canal, and clean the left side of your mouth. and was confused because I was there for something completely different, I think one of the things that should be done is have something written out which plan of action is being taken at each appointment, so their is no confusion, especially in cases when their is a lot of work to be done.

They made it work with my insurance, that is the thing that I am most grateful about this place, Dr Papp is legendary, I have a maybe a handful of dentist in my life, and from my experience, he is truly, a cut above the rest. when I went to my 4th appointment, the root canal that final got done, was a supper-smooth process, he dialogs great with customers, and he is world class. If you get a choice I would go With ""big papa!"" That's what I call him in my head.

This location doesn't discuss preventive care much with patients, so it is important to make sure you ask them, to keep the work they do intact. If you make an appointment, they will not leave you in the dark,  the with email you and text you often to remind you, so they have great follow-up, But If you can't make an appointment let them know because they have a big customer base They bake cookies fresh every day so they definitely make an effort, to make a great atmosphere, But just a few things to work out."
851,"After an eye infection flared on Friday and seemed to be getting progressively worse.... by Sunday I thought it imperative to seek medical attention. 

Last night we picked up drugstore antibiotic eye drops with the hopes of kicking this. With work starting again tomorrow and that worry of not getting better, we went to google and looked at places open today. We found this clinic - which was a less than 5 minute walk from brighouse Canada line terminus station. 

Inside the many chairs seemed occupied by 5 pairs of people with one person ahead waiting to be checked in. Once I was checked in (after filling out a basic form and presenting ID etc) I was advised it may be 30 minutes. Today Dr Xion is in 9-2. Offered to have a seat or come back in 30 minutes, low and behold in about 30 minutes it was my turn. 

I was asked to goto room 4. In less than 5 minutes the doctor came in. He listened and answered all my questions and a stronger medication suggested.  It was wonderful especially because he did a couple more tests than JUST noting my symptoms - which was great to see. 

My boyfriend and I left and went to London drugs just up and around the corner to get the medicine. Best walk-in clinic visit ever."
852,"I would recommend going here. Their dental hygienist, Cathy is friendly, informative, and very thorough. Sadly they are now considered out of network with my insurance so now I have to find a new dentist."
853,"Um... Loved my doctor here. But was just treated so poorly by the office staff that I can't see continuing the relationship. 

Called in to schedule an appointment for my 1.5-year old and my newborn baby and, rather than say something friendly like ""wow new baby congratulations!"" the angry staff person told me they I had a ""bad debt"" of $63 and wasn't welcome to schedule any appointments. A transfer to an equally rude billing person was equally kind and gentle. 

Umm... This is my first time hearing about this, no big deal but.... I have spent thousands in this office and you're treating me like a criminal over $63? Did you send a bill? You didn't ask but we recently moved so I may not have seen it if you did. Really not concerned about $63 but you clearly are - enough to alienate a patient who called trying to schedule appointments for not one but two babies. 

Explain to me why I would allow you to touch my child if you're that rude to your patients?

Update: my newborn will have her first appointment with her new doctor on Monday - which means she will have her first vaccination at 4 months old. With the measles outbreak that's super awesome. Haven't heard a peep out of SWP about ""how are your kids, how is the baby, how are you?"" But, since I took the time to update my address on the infamous call reviewed above they did take the time to send me certified mail demanding $63 or they won't see my kids anymore. No ""hey you're baby is 4 months old and your 1.5 year old is way overdue for some vaccinations."" Heart warming.

I should also mention here that my vet calls me every 3 months to check in on my black lab and remind me when she's due for a shot or vaccination."
854,"I had an appt today at 1pm. I based my entire work day around my appt. I could have gone into work earlier in the day, but that would have not allowed me to make my appt. Because of that, I decided to work after my appt. 

I get to my appt at 1pm and staff tells me that their entire computer system is down. That in turn means that the doc can see me, but can not give me any type of medical advise because they will not have access to my blood work which was done a week prior. 

Staff was aware that their system was down all day since this morning. I asked the staff why didn't they call me in the 
morning to make me aware of their issue so that I could have planned my day accordingly. All the guy could tell me was that he was sorry and that I would have to call back on Tuesday, after 4th of July, to reschedule because appt can only be done over the phone. 

Forget this damn place. Time to find another doc!!!!"
855,"I just spoke with Sara, business owner and Evans Derm has resolved my billing issue completely! She called me immediately and spoke with their outsourced pathology lab herself to figure out why my bill was so high. I will be paying much less now than the original bill, an amount that is reasonable and I can actually afford.

I am so appreciative of Sara with her help on this issue and so glad she was able to find a solution so quickly!

I've made another appointment with Evans Derm and will have my health needs taken care of. What a relief!




*Reason for update below*





I have received 2 bills from this business and am shocked at the price! 

The office visit and skin check plus mole removal was almost $500. My insurance which is through Aetna paid almost nothing of that bc my deductible is $1000 and I'm a healthy young adult with no medical problems so this was my only visit to a dr last year. So I paid their office $274 out of pocket. 

Today I received a 2nd bill from their out sourced pathology for $422!!!!! Are you kidding me? I called them and their fees for looking at my Mole was over $700, and less my insurance was my payment due of $422! 

I am beyond overwhelmed that I am paying $700 for a skin check and mole removal. 

I cancelled my next appointment bc who can afford that? The sad part is I really think I do need to have another skin biopsy and am really risking my health by not having it done. 

I am praying that there is a better place that doesn't charge this much just for a basic mole removal! 

And for the record, I have good insurance despite the $1,000 deductible. I pay at a 2nd tier level per month. I don't think that I should have to pay $700 out of pocket for a visit to a dr for such a basic service. I'm not blaming my insurance for being what they are, bc lets be real insurance is a huge sham and they do just about anything to make a dollar. I'm just angry bc I pay a lot of money every month for insurance then go the dr, use my insurance and the dr and lab charges so much that the discount is not even worth having. Why and how is it possible that looking at a mole costs $700? Ridiculous. 

My copay for an ER visit is $200, I could have cut my own mole off and then gone to the ER and spent less money."
856,"My mother has gotten off all medication prescribed by NP Sharon Shepherd and her blood pressure has returned to normal ranges. 

My wife has seen a legitimate doctor and told the hormones she was prescribed were dangerous for her. He said he was surprised someone would prescribe something of that nature without prior blood work.

Doctor Pekar is a great doctor and has tried to fix all the things Sharon did to my mom. So far so good. Still two stars until Sharon is gone."
857,"I recently had a surgical procedure performed here and was a bit nervous leading to the surgery date.  I've never been on anesthesia or sedation and was literally dreading going in to say the least.  

My procedure required me to have commute assistance and did not allow me to drive home alone post procedure.  Luckily, they work with Metro West ambulatory service that offer pay-for transport to and from your procedure.  

When I arrived there were other people waiting in the seating area.  I didn't know whether they were patients like me that were waiting for surgery or if they were waiting for someone they dropped off for surgery.  

When the nurse came to the front counter and greeted me things were fine up to when we got to the surgery prep area with the IV machine and bed.  I may not have been visually nervous but I was absolutely nervous considering it was my first time being in this environment - never had a broken bone in more than 40 years.  

The nurse had phenomenal bedside manner making me feel more comfortable the more we talked.  It was a bit of a challenge initially  trying to find an appropriate vein to insert the IV that had to go through the reverse side of my hand unlike a regular blood test.  

After the nurse left and about 10 mins I had to use the restroom one last time before the actual procedure.  I knew to press the button that the nurse informed me of before she left if I needed anything.  Another nurse came to walk me to the restroom because I was literally attached to the IV unit.  This I later learned may have been the physician assistant that accompanied the specialist during the actual procedure.  

When I got back from the restroom my specialist came to talk with me about any last minute reservations or questions I might have.  Then the nurse that was responsible for administrating the anesthesia came to talk to me and then rolled me down the aisle toward the operating room.  

Once I got in there I thought I had gotten past the nervousness part up until the anesthesia administering nurse mentioned the possible effects of such medications just seconds before doing it.  I thought that was a bit odd but the nurse had a comforting presence so I went with it already preparing myself mentally for the worst.  I woke up toward the latter part of the procedure so I was able to observe a portion of the procedure.  

I was then rolled back to the prep area and was greeted by yet another nurse that provided me with a soda and crackers.  Doesn't seem like much but if you have ever been on a liquid diet for several days this quick meal made me feel so much better.  

After getting my things from my locker I walked back to the front counter where the front desk check in person told me that Metro West was waiting for me.  Got back in the ride with Metro West and was home it seemed quicker than it did on the initial commute.  I have to say my overall experience was really good considering it was my first time having a surgical procedure.  Part of the entire process is believing that the doctors and nurses that are there will take care of you to the best of their ability.  I was happy with my experience here and wanted to write a review about my experience."
858,"He is the biggest jerk ever. Extremely rude, childish, and unprofessional. Scheduled 4 other people for appointments at the same time as me. Had to wait 2 hours. Then he stormed out of the room and slammed the door when we pointed out that 4 other people had the same appointment time. He also responded by saying ""Its not my fault!"" in a very childish and whiny voice. I would go anywhere but here. Check out Dr. Reschly...he is a GREAT dermatologist."
859,"I have been a pt of Dr. Veals for several years, up until recently. Let me start by saying that I am in the medical field and have been for over 10 years. As a provider and a consumer, I must say, the recent experience I have had with my dentist, is less than par. Recently had him fill a cavity, it was over $400 dollars (which I never worried about price- I thought I was receiving the best of the best) and at the end of the exam he told me that it may or may not need a root canal. A few days later I returned with some discomfort and wanted him to check in case of abscess. He assured me that it was ok (as he usually did with other fillings) but did share with me that on another tooth that he had placed a filling last year 2014, he saw a new cavity. Upon checkout his new office manager (very rude) told me that I owed over $100 for that visit and she also gave me pricing on treatment for the new finding. Let me mention that I would constantly frequent his office with issues relating to the work done. Now I am seeing why.

That was the straw that weakened the camels back.... I have spent thousands of dollars collectively over the past few years, and now he wants to charge me for checking a service that was already rendered? And I am not eating bags of candy, so how am I getting cavitys on top of others? Perhaps the work isn't quality.

 At the request of a surgeon colleague of mine, I went to see a new dentist in the Alpharetta location (Dr. Mazer) What an experience! The office is beautiful, his staff is accommodating and the professionalism is amazing. I have NEVER had such a thorough exam and cleaning. He took individual pictures of each tooth, and explained everything in detail. Then we arrived at the tooth that not even 2 weeks before, Dr. Veal had filled. The tooth still had a portion of stain, which this new dentist, explained could easily turn into decay. He did not understand why this issue was not addressed when the tooth was prepped. STRIKE 1 

I told him my dental history and he looked puzzled and offered to fix this area free of charge. Needless to say, I am now a new patient of Dr. Mazer's ( I feel comfortable and he's an honest provider.) Today... today did it- I went to the new office to have Mazer check a filling (one that Dr. Veal filled a year ago,) and it is failing, shearing, and needs to be replaced!! I called Dr. Veal's office and got no answers, no remedy... nothing. The office manager tried to say that the filling was a year and a half old. Ive had filling last over 10 years- STAND BEHIND YOUR WORK~ Why would I want to come into the same office that at my last visit, treated me so poorly? And why would I let a dentist that has been working on my teeth for years.... provide another treatment, after the initial had failed?? Am I missing something? I was a dental patient who was in the office way more than necessary, and now I know why.

I would NOT recommend this office- Dr. Veal is a pleasant guy, but there is something to be said about professionalism- and being courteous. You should NOT have to frequent your dentist as much as I did. I feel like ""he got my money,"" and that's all that matters. I am not one to bash or write a bad review, but  being in healthcare.. this is just unacceptable. Save your money... your time.. and your teeth."
860,"If anyone is looking for IVF, I would avoid this place for many reasons. First and foremost is the success rate. Research of success rates will show that Westlake IVF has the lowest or one of the lowest rates in Austin. Furthermore, their lab isn't even certified (to what certification, I do not know, but they told us that their lab was hoping to gain certification). Dr. Kavoussi is a smooth talker, but the hard data is what is important.

Other issues include that Dr. Kavoussi has no belief in ERA testing which other offices will do to maximize success. Dr. Kavoussi also believes in ""wasting"" other viable embryos due to lower grading (e.g. B grading). I believe that he does this to maximize his chance at gaining certification with the result of many people losing viable embryos.

Furthermore this office is poorly run. We have had numerous instances where we show up for testing and no lab requests are present. They have sent us to their second location and then tell us to go to the other location across town. They have not ordered meds when needed. This office is staffed by poorly trained employees; if you visit other IVF clinics in town, you will see the difference in structure, follow up and training.

This office is also very cheap. From the moment you walk in, you can see how cheap they are. They also charge you a surcharge on all credit card transactions which is against the TOS for merchant services. 

Their pricing is also one of the most expensive. Most expensive with poor service and poor success rates. Don't make the mistake that we did and avoid this place."
861,"1 minute past 10pm, and the hrs changed at the pharmacy.  I called earlier to verify my prescriptions & make sure hrs were the same, was told open until 11pm, and my prescriptions were ready. I called the pharmacy & even though I was given wrong info they would not allow me to pick up my prescriptions even though I was at the door. Cascade Park Pharmacy has become one of the worst pharmacys in regards to customer service & giving out correct info. I think my final decision has come to change drs. This is the worst place ever. I now have no anxiety meds, nor pain ointments.  Thank you kaiser for your info."
862,"Dr. Garcia was VERY rude. She should not work in pediatric care.

This was our third time coming to this urgent care location. The wait was not long we got there half hour after they opened and were seen in 20 minutes. We paid $160 at first to see the doctor and afterwards before leaving we checked back in and were told we are a tier 2 so it'd be $200 for doctors visit and additional for flu test. So we paid roughly $300 total. We are self paid patients.

Dr. Garcia is NOT a nice doctor. I informed her after she told me she wanted to test my almost 2 year old for the flu. That the last time she had her staff test my son for the flu the male nurse did it so rough that my son bled in his nose and that I would not allow them to test him unless they would do it gentle and the ""appropriate"" way. She, Dr. Garcia opened the door to leave turned and as she was part way out said ""what do you want me to do! It's either you test him or you don't and go home!"" In a loud rude voice. 

I was so upset and so embarrassed. Very unprofessional. I said to her I will only allow it only if it's a different nurse from last time doing the swab and they must do it gentle. She said she will tell the nurse. The nurse that came in after her was the same one who took my sons height and weight when we were called back and she was super gentle and kind. From the very beginning and we are so grateful for her. She is from Nigeria. 
The doctor returned later to tell us that he did not have the flu and we informed her that this female nurse was kind and gentle and did a great job in the flu swab. She then said are you sure the person who hurt your son was on my team?! I said ""YES. We've been here three times now trust me I remember seeing you each visit."" She kept denying that it could be someone from her crew. How would she know? She didn't even remember ever treating us before... 

Dr Garcia, she is not a nice person especially to be working in pediatric care. I'm praying they replace her with another doctor. She doesn't deserve the privilege of working with sick kids."
863,"I just had a massage with Len Pinnkowski and it was excellent. He is a true master. My body feels so much better. I felt very comfortable the entire treatment and the work on my shoulders, hands, and arms feels like I have a new body. I was feeling very jammed up with the work I do. I had not had a massage by a male therapist before but after reading his reviews I thought maybe he could help. So happy with my body function and will be returning in the future for positive."
864,"I had a plastic surgery procedure over 3 years ago at Hall Plastic Surgery in Westlake, results where not bad however my eyebrows are still uneven.  A year ago I noticed a spot (scab the size of a dime) in my left sideburn.  I went to my dermatologist and she scraped it off and sent it to pathology.  Pathology was inconclusive.  6 months go by and the scab comes back with a vengence, larger now and thicker (the size of a quarter).  Went to my dermatologist and she says ""I fear for the worst I am going to refer you to a cancer surgeon"".  Two days later I am at the surgeon's and he is preparing to cut the scab/growth off when he asks me;  ""have you ever had sutures in this area?""  I had to think but then respond yes I had a plastic surgery procedure over 3 years ago and I do beleive there were sutures there.  To my surprise he says that it what this is your surgeon left 2 sutures is that should have been removed and they are trying to work there way out of your body.

So would I recommend Dr. Hall, no I would not.  Going through the scare of thinking you have cancer when it is merely an oversight on your surgeon's part, definately not worth it."
865,"Dr. Choi = awesome. She's very perceptive to exactly what her patient needs. She'll ask multiple times if the numbing injection is working and if I feel any pain during the drilling portion. She works fast and she'll provide an estimated time for how long I should expect to be there. I also still have my wisdom teeth in and she referred me to an oral surgeon to make sure I get the teeth taken care of. 

Dr. Choi is patient, kind and listens to my needs. At the beginning of the appointment, she asks how I'm doing, if I feel any pain, how the fillings from last time feel, etc. She is awesome! I hate going to the dentist, but she makes me not dread going.  

Her care is very comprehensive and I feel very well taken care of under her! 10/10 would recommend!"
866,"*Updated 4/28/17*
I still stand by the care and quality of dental work that the dentists provide. I had a filling crack and break a week after it was filled, but Dr. Dobrin was able to fill it for me the next morning. He was extremely gentle and thorough the whole time. 

I knocked off a star though, because I was under quoted by a little more than half a grand. They did give me a 50% courtesy wave, which is great customer service. However, the drastic difference in what was actually covered and what was quoted to me probably shouldn't have happened.

867,I have gone to this practice for both of my pregnancies and had a great experience both times.  The wait times for office appts. was very minimal and all the Drs. in the practice were nice and easy to speak with.  Dr. Pettyjohn ended up delivering both my sons and she was a wonderful Dr. and everything went smoothly and she had a great bedside manner.  I wholly recommend this practice.
868,"This practice is a joke. After many mishaps...unfilled prescription refill requests, unreasonable wait times for appointments, difficulty receiving tests results without calling them numerous times until finally scheduling my husband's  appointment for high blood pressure (initial diagnosis) on 4th of July. And yes, he asked twice if she was sure the office would be open and was repeatedly assured they would. Well you guessed it! THEY WERE CLOSED!
These ladies, Dr. Jorro and the Nurse Practioners may be intelligent medical people, however, their business practice warrants review by the American Medical Association. It borders on negligence at the least."
869,"My experience started in the Tufts ER.   I had a dental abscess in a filling that my own dentist replaced.  He did the initial procedure and prescribed me 2 weeks of penicillin, and told me to come back in 3 weeks for root canal.  The antibiotics didn't work, so I called my own dentist on Saturday to see if he could see me, but he couldn't.  So...grin and bear it until Monday, right?  Wrong.  I woke up in the middle of the night Sunday in agony.  I couldn't take the pain and my face was swollen and I felt a little feverish.  SO....everything you read on dental sites says this requires attention.  So I look for an ER and discovered Tufts-they advertise that they see dental emergencies.  I arrived and was admitted by 5am, but I was there 2 hours waiting to hear from the on-call dentist.  Finally the med student comes in and says ""the dentist said she *could* come see you, but there really is nothing she can do for you since there's no dental equipment.  You could wait and go to the emergency dental clinic that opens at 9am"".    So what are my options?  I'm frustrated and in very bad pain and feeling bad.   They offer me a percocet to hold me over.  Nurse gives me 1 pill and watches me take it.   The doctor comes in and apologizes and says he spoke with the dentist and I should go over now to put my name on the waiting list.  They will be waiting for me as an ER referral.    I've been here over 2 hours and it's 2 more hours until the dental clinic opens.  I get to dental clinic around 8:30 and gave all my insurance info, then waited to be called.  To my surprise, they called me pretty quickly, which I was grateful for.  By this time I'm completely exhausted from the lack of sleep and all the pain and the percocet, which has only caused me to feel tired and did not touch the pain.   The staff at the clinic were wonderful.  I first met with a slightly nervous student who did all of his tests, and called over his dentist to look who said the area had gotten much more infected and I probably need stronger antibiotics.   She also said they cannot do root canals in this clinic, but she would call up to the endodontic graduate clinic to see if someone can take me in.   She came back and said that they could take me, and to go up to the 11th floor clinic.  Wonderful....I can see relief in sight.   SO I'm escorted to the 11th floor - and this is where the BAD review begins.  Everyone in there has an attitude.  I'm trying my best to hold it together, because I just need some relief.  Check -in, taken by tall red headed endodontic intern or resident or whatever he is.   He's pleasant at the front desk, until we get to his chair. He reviews my xrays and proceeds to make me feel like a complete ass for wasting his valuable time in his clinic.  He goes on to say, in his lovely arrogant condescending way, that this clinic is by appointment and he doesn't think there's anything he can do for me.  SO....WHY did you agree to have me sent up from the emergency clinic?   WHY did you drag me up here to make me feel like I've done something wrong?  I RE-explain that I was seen by my own dentist, and followed protocol, but the penicillin has not worked and things have gotten terribly bad.   He begrudgingly reclines my chair, so that I'm practically upside down, and starts prodding around. Once I sit up again, I ask him if he can do the root canal or not. He says no, that's not something he can do without an appointment and since another dentist already did the pulpectomy, he wasn't going to finish his work.  AND...he goes on to say that the tooth is badly damaged and probably beyond saving. So I asked him to pull the tooth.   He refuses because he says I'm being rash (hello??  I've been in your facility for 6 hours now, and I've been in tooth pain for over 2 weeks....it's not rash).    SO....there's a long silence between us and he's puttering with his tools.   He finally says 'I'm not trying to make you feel bad....""   UM...thanks for the bedside manner doc, but it's too late.  He says he can do something to get me out of pain, but I need to go back to my own dentist (see note from Saturday when I already tried my own dentist!)    He gives 3 very hard injections of Novocaine, which don't take.  I tell him, so he says he has something stronger. Doesn't tell me what it is - foul tasting/smelling awful.  I'm numb.   He does his thing and sends me on my way with 2 Advil.  An hour later, I'm in agony - worse than when I started!  For hours, pain in my whole head, sinuses, neck....I finally get to see a real endodontist on Thursday who said the work he did was awful, and he didn't remove stones that needed to come out, so the infection couldn't drain.  AND the infection has gotten very bad, and I should have been prescribed something stronger last week.  Now, I have to wait another 3 weeks for root canal while infection heals.  Thanks for the great work Tufts Endodontic Clinic!"
870,"First off, I'd like to praise the staff for their friendliness. And Dr. Gorin was always very timely with his responses to my questions via texts. But here's the problem: so I got my breast augmentation in August 2014. I went from a small A cup to a 32D. I wanted to end up as a small C cup at most, but again, wound up as a 32D. I'm 5'6"" with an athletic frame, sooo... now I look like a Barbie. Not the look I was going for. In fact, quite the opposite. You see, I'm a sports and lifestyle model signed with an agency in Portland. In fact, days before the procedure I was modeling for Nike for 3 weeks. So as you can guess, my new pair of overly large breasts didn't help my modeling career, it's pretty much killed it. 

You have to understand, my mum's friend used to work for Dr. Gorin (that's how I heard about his clinic) and told me he does free revisions up to a year if any of his patients are dissatisfied. That's what sold me. It gave me complete confidence that I was going with the right surgeon.

So I consulted with my agents prior to scheduling the operation and as hesitant as they were, I reassured them it'd be a subtle enhancement, so they gave me their blessings. However, things didn't go as planned and now I am top-heavy. My agents even told me [my implants] have taken me out of the ""young and fresh"" category. Aka 'get them fixed or you're done with modeling.' I was heartbroken. Beforehand, my modeling was going swimmingly... I mean, I paid a lot of money to enhance my athletic / petite figure and it's SUCH a shame my implants turned out way larger than I ever wanted. My agents are always bringing them up and clients have even complained about them.

So after all the bad news from my agency, I went back for another appointment in hopes of taking him up on the free-revision policy. Yet to my dismay, the staff informed me they no longer honour that. Oh nooo. My heart sunk. 

I wish I could work out some sort of deal with Dr. Gorin whether it be me promoting him on social media or whatever! Anything!!"
871,I wouldn't trust anyone else with my skin -- they have the best research facility and all the cutting edge technology and top notch doctors in the country. And their attention to my care is incredible -- they tailor to my needs and the staff is friendly and accommodating. Dr. Dover is extremely  professional and always so friendly. Finally getting to the bottom of my eczema and my skin has never looked so great.
872,"Excellent service from start to finish!

I update my eyeglasses every year.  I have to move around so finding a good eyeglass place is always a top priority when I get into a new city.  The website for Columbus Eyeworks was very helpful, I was able to see they had some nice styles and they carried my type of contact lens (I wear gas perms, not everyone fits them).  

Once in the shop I was able to wander around their expansive displays.  They carry a variety of reasonable styles (the ones I picked out were from $150-$300 a frame).  Their sales staff was very helpful.  Dr. Koch was very professional and friendly. He took the time to chat with me about my contact lens care, how I wore them, what type of glasses I preferred, etc.  

Overall, I was very pleased with the experience.  If it costs a lot of $$, well, yes, it's on your face.  It's the first thing people see.  I for one want to love my glasses and get a quality product.  Columbus Eyeworks definitely provided that.  

BTW, parking is in the back, it's not too hard to get to, and it's within a short walk of all the neat shops in the short north."
873,"(You'll be a dentist! You have a talent for causing things pain!)

For years, I avoided going to the dentist, for one reason or another. Just couldn't do it. I knew it had to be done. So easy to find excuses not to go.

I finally went to Hanle a few years ago, since both my dad and step-mom went to him and recommended the gentle touch.

(Here he is, folks, the leader of the plaque!)

The first cleaning was not terrific, but I guess that's my fault. They did what they had to do. One of the assistants did all the gritty sandpaper toothpaste stuff, and then Hanle came in and checked on me. He was nice and gentle, even though I feared what he would say waiting so long to go back to the dentist.

(I'm your dentist. And I get off on the pain I inflict.)

I've been back for several cleanings since the initial one.

Not all that long ago, I felt an awful pain in a tooth. I called and got in almost immediately. Turns out I had to get a root canal. (Yee-haw!)

(And when I start extracting those molars, You girls will be scaring like Holy Rollers)

I never knew it was a several-visit ordeal.  He did a good job of explaining what had to be done.

I gladly took the gas they offered. It was enough to make things okay. And the numbing, well, it makes all the pain not there.  I was sore for a bit afterwards, but not so much on the spot of the canal, but the jaw muscles. 

('Cause I'm a dentist... And a success!)

If you're in search of a dentist, I highly recommend him. The office staff has always been very friendly and his assistants are nice as well, and help alleviate the many fears we all have.

And, no, he's nothing like the dentist referenced here."
874,"I bought the six laser hair removal treatments through Groupon.  The staff was really nice but I did have some trouble making appointments.  After all six treatments (which I thought were relatively painful), I still had hair growth on my underarm.  Tristen was the person doing the procedure (super nice) and until the last couple of treatments she had the machine on about the highest setting.  Thrive called and asked how everything was going and when I said that I had hair growth still, the lady on the phone said I could either purchase one treatment for $100 or another package.  Since I got the Groupon for around that price, it really didn't seem worth it.  I thought, well what if 7 treatments don't work?  Another $100?  Since I didn't get the results I wanted and they couldn't work with me on price, I gave them 3 stars.  Maybe others will have better luck."
875,"I took my son into the ER last night. When we checked in the waiting room was pretty full so we anticipated a bit of a wait. He had his vitals taken relatively quickly but was then put back in the waiting room with the promise of being called as soon as his labs were back. I got the lab results on my phone within 30 minutes but we continued to sit for more than 2 hours. We watched others come and go but we were never called back. Finally, at 11:30pm, we left. When we went to leave they wanted us to sign a form acknowledging we were leaving ""against doctors orders"" but WE NEVER SAW A DOCTOR so I'm not sure how that works....

Also, my son is very sick. Fever, headache, stabbing pain in his upper abdomen and yellowing of the whites of his eyes. We weren't there for a silly reason, but apparently it wasn't serious enough for Kaiser ER."
876,"They offer Covid-19 testing. I recommend you wait in the line at the convention center or another testing site instead.... might be a long wait but you'd get your results in a timely manner. My husband has been waiting TWO WEEKS for his, and they keep assuring us that ""any day now"" they'll have them. I had to be tested twice, they called me and told me my results were negative... when I called to verify the date of the test, they said they didn't have any results for me at all....? Not sure how that works. Now I have to be on standby to see what my results will be for either test. Definitely NOT something you want to be unsure or make a mistake about!!!!"
877,"With the Flu epidemic sweeping our nation, I'd like to think a clinic or any medical facility would take it seriously as to nip the virus in the butt preventing it from spreading and perpetuating this Flu season we can't seem to shake. 

After trying two failed attempts with clinics before this one due to them being out of Flu tests, I came across FastMed and happily walked in when there wasn't a sign on the door notifying patients that there were out of the Flu tests. At least the previous clinics notified you before you even stepped in the door. This place did not notify me until I filled out all the paperwork and just thought to ask. They replied so nonchalantly, 'oh no we don't have the flu test, but we can prescribe you Tamiflu based on your systems. And good thing, we only have two more weeks of flu season.' Ummm? I am not sure how that works. Just in two weeks, the flu magically disappears? It's not like a countdown to Christmas and all of a sudden it's gone. I stuck around because they could still hopefully determine if I had the flu and give me the preventive meds. I wouldn't normally be worried and just ride it out without the Tamiflu, but with a kid under 2 at home, I really wanted to take precautions, which I made clear to them. But then the part that really irked me with this visit occurred. The receptionist asked...'is it just a cold or just allergies?' 'Well,' I replied, 'You tell me.' Why are you asking me what I have and please don't try to downplay what I have or what I am feeling because you're out of the flu test and there's 'only two more weeks of the flu season.'

The did give me a strep test, which came back positive. I then asked if it was possible to have the flu, as well. And their way of determining based on my symptoms was that it 'didn't look like I had the flu.' I explained, I didn't want to get my child sick if I did have. They sent me on my way saying the Step and Flu symptoms are too similar to tell the difference between the two and I left without the Tamiflu prescription. I went directly to an ER Clinic and received a flu test that also came back positive. So, I did end up having Strep and The Flu but ended up having to have another clinic tell me that. I am thankful to have learned I had it and treat it properly, but a little concerned that this clinic was not treating patients accordingly, thus perpetuating this flu sickness!"
878,"I won't be going back. While the Dr. was professional and I appreciated her, the office staff was terrible. There wasn't much pleasantry. They handed me papers and I was unsure what they were because I was on my way out without my glasses on. There was no explanation and when I asked about the prescription they simply said that was the blue paper I gave you. I asked if they had a recommendation as to where to get orthotics and they simply said it is on the sheet. There was some confusion about when I was supposed to come in for a follow up visit and they were abrupt about the process, It was as if they were in a hurry to get me out of there. The staff is the main group I have to deal with so I won't return. There are other doctors in town."
879,"This location has left a sour taste in my mouth. First of all, I inquired about services and was contacted in a timely manner. I told the receptionist that I would need a Friday AFTER noon. She confirms this time is available and schedules my appointment. The day of the appointment I received (what I thought was) a courtesy call. Turns out I was scheduled for Friday at 10:30AM. Seriously, I reiterated the importance of needing something after 12 as I work a half day Friday and its convenient. She tells me I will need to reschedule and the next date is two weeks out. Flash forward today and low-and-behold there's another mix up and I am forced to rescheduled. At this point I am DONE with Great Expressions before I even got started. Judging from some of these other Yelp experiences, I'd say I dodge a bullet. 

Stop hiring idiots as receptionist... that would be a great start. Completely incompetent staffing."
880,"I was using Village Fertility Pharmacy while living in MA in August for IVF meds - they were fine. No issues. I am now living in AZ and due to insurance coverage needed to use them again as they are an in network provider and the AZ speciality pharmacies are not covered. I needed them to overnight my medicine to keep on track (to start a scheduled cycle I paid for meds over a weekend out of pocket to get me through - but overnighting these when dr and I called in early should have been no big deal). As everyone knows this process is hard and you are supposed to manage stress. The stress this pharmacy has caused is crazy.  

On Tuesday my dr called the pharmacy, I called (they called me back to confirm something) they said everything was good and being shipped that day. At 7:15 pm eastern they called and said they didn't ship as info was missing. At that point my dr was gone and there was no hope of getting the meds I needed out.  On Wed early morning my dr called them back with what they needed, I called them - ok we are set... I thought. Around 4 pm eastern I called again to check and waiting on hold for about 30 mins, I couldn't wait longer and had to go back to work. I called again at 6 pm and they told me nothing shipped! No apologies just they were backed up. 

I'm now half way through an IVF cycle with no meds and have to pay out of pocket from a pharmacy the insurance company doesn't approve and fight it out with them or abandon an already difficult process I'm half way through! 

Beware and don't trust this pharmacy has your back or is giving you the right info."
881,Dr. Lifshen is great but the practice is driven by making money and not patient care - you will have to pay $10 each time you ask for a refill - who does that??  You can also plan on having every test your insurance will pay for done.  Evidently they have an office manager more interested in money that patient care or patient retention - the manager should worry more about fixing all the billing errors.  Sad that a good doctor can be brought down by greed.
882,Moved to the area and have been unable to find an accupuncture person that was as good as my person in NC. I think I found them at SUMA. Felt better after the visit and still do so the next day.
883,"I'm sorry I cannot mirror the enthusiasm other posters have regarding my visit today. I've used ZC for 2 prior injuries and have had average but not amazing visits-nothing to complain about. Today I went in on the advice of my primary care physician to get a referral for a MRI on a MVA. I spent approximately 8 minutes chatting with a physician's assistant.

We discussed:
1) what the problem was-3 minutes
2) why zoomcare doesn't refer mri's
3) the fact he would print out a couple of referrals to clinics that might provide a referral 

Done-10 minutes max. Bear in mind this is on a PIP claim for a auto injury with limited funds for me to obtain treatment.

When I got to the check out, I was expecting the $150 I've paid previously a d asked how much as I figured I'd pay to save the PIP money for actual treatment. $499!

Zoomcare charged me $499 to tell me they don't refer the treatment I need after I filled out the application form specifying what I needed. Total scam.

I'm very disappointed and upset, and will attempt to rectify this with customer service, but I have a feeling I'll be stuck with the.bill. Egregious business practices,clearly focused on the bottom line rather than communication or God forbid actually healing people. This doctor didn't even touch me. business practices"
884,"WORST URGENT CARE I HAVE EVER BEEN TOO! 
I went in last Tuesday, I was so sick. I had a sore throat, ear infetion, horrible cough, and body chills and I thought I have strep. I went to this place and saw the P.A. a larger woman (who by the way shook my hand afterI was coughing and sneezing it in all day, gross) She provider horrible care, was rude, didnt seem to care about me at all, didnt ask me any basic health questions, gave me a Z-Pac. and sent me on my way. Two days later, I still felt like crap. I called in, requesting they call me in cough syrup. They would not. The medical assistant they had talking to me didnt know what he was doing. He said the Z-Pac would help me ""feel better"". I asked him to explain to me what ""feel better"" means. Would my cought go away? Would I stop coughing up flem? Would my fever go away? WHAT!? Becuase obviously I was still sick and getting worse. I requested a call back from the doctor. A manager, Julia from the office called me back. I explained my frustration to her, with the PA, the medical assistant and not getting the right meds, etc. She questioned as to why I would want cough syrup because the only thing on my chart was ""ear ache"". I threw a fit. I listed off at least 8 symptoms I was having that day, and that medical assistant obviously couldnt comprehende english, some girl named Brendel or something. I told that manager that I wanted cough syrup called in. and that I wanted my $30.00 co pay back, as I was not treated right and still sick. I also told her that I though I had strep and she said, ""ohhh? they didnt do a strep test?"" I said no. She said she would look things over and call me back (this was on a thursday afternoon around 330pm). FRIDAY, no call. Sat and Sun, closed. Monday, up to 330pm, no call. I called her Monday at 330pm. She said. ""oh, I was going to call you later in the day""... Julia said she talked to the doctor on the medical board, Dr. Williams, and he felt that cough syrup was not appropriate for my symptoms. He said that he would not reimburse the $30.00 co pay and that in his opinion I was given the appropriate medical care. I told her that is BULL. I went to the emergency room on Saturday morning. They told me I had: a double ear infection, the flu, laryngitis, kidney infection and bronchitis. I was VERY SICK and this urgent care did nothing for me. I told her I wanted him to call me, and I am still requesting to have my $30.00 reimbursed to me. I have made a complaint to Atena health insurance, and I will continue to tell everyone about my horrible experience here. I told Julia, they dont care about their patients because, when I called in Thursday stating I will still sick, and asked for medicane, they never asked to have me come back in. Julia didnt care enough to call me back during normal business hours on Friday, or Monday fo that matter, and after all her bullcrap she fed me, she still didnt offer for me to come back in and make it right. NEVER GO HERE! 
and by the way... this is the nice short story.

Update: i did end up receiving my $30.00 co pay back... So fight!"
885,"If I could pick zero stars I would! Beware! The front desk people are rude, nasty and unknowledgeable!!!  At first they made me angry now after speaking to Austin again I can't decide whether to scream or cry.  My advice is ""NEVER EVER"" go to this dental practice!! If you need the abuse make someone angry on the drive to another dentist. The name calling and the middle finger are much less painful than dealing with the office staff at Smiles Dental in Camas'!!!!"
886,"Terrible experience here. I had an ingrown toe that Cherpack did surgery on and AFTER he butchered my nail, he told me it was too stuck and he had to cut extra. The way he cut my nail is so ugly and unnatural, the nail has not grown back normal since. It looks terrible and I've been in pain for months since. Never going back to this malpractice nightmare."
887,"After visiting several surgeons for my surgery desires I settled on Dr. Oppenheimer due to his personality and excellent surgical results. I was very excited to be going through this procedure with him.

Overall his office staff was nice and easy to work with but the problems began with billing. I was not aware the full amount was due a month before the surgery. I am willing to accept that either I missed that information or it was not articulated to me but I was unaware. I was out of town on Christmas vacation when I got the call to make the final payment. I had no way to make the payment from my location. They agreed to wait for my return.  There was an agreement to get this squared away. I never once yelled or cursed but was emphatic because it was slightly frustrating trying to get it together.

The real breakdown occurred yesterday. After being told my mamogram results were good and I was cleared for surgery, the sent me an EMAIL  telling me I had a concern they needed addressed. The doctor had not looked at my results and I was cleared for surgery under false information. Not only that but now I am also scared I may have breast cancer. 

I then called Erica and left her voicemail because I was scared and frustrated with the lack of information. I mentioned cancelling the surgery. She called me back and left me a voicemail saying if I canceled the surgery I would lose a huge chunk of money. I have the voicemail to prove this! So I again called her back and now I was very frustrated. They missed reading a report and were stating I was going to be penalized for it! So yes my next conversations were not great but again I didn't yell or curse or scream. I was incredibly frustrated!

I set up the appointment to get my follow up mamogram for today. I got a call from Tammy telling me they no longer wanted me as a patient because our relationship was bad. I lost the Dr I wanted for a procedure because of multiple communication breakdowns on their part and had a delay in diagnosis due to no one qualified looking at my test results.

I'm sure Dr Oppenheimer is a great surgeon but if you want to proceed with him make sure you never give them feedback. They clearly do not want to fix their office procedures and make it smoother for the next person!"
888,"I've been to Jester Dental for a number of years and often wondered about some of the charges, now and then. It sometimes felt ""odd"" but I didn't question it knowing how funky insurance can be.  However, recently, there were too many issues to ignore when I asked them to check on predetermined costs for needed crowns. Long story short, the ""quote"" kept going up each time I checked. For example, my portion was going to be $305 (per crown, I needed 3), a few weeks later, it was $349 each, then the actual day of the procedure, it was that 2 remained at $349 and 1 was not going to be covered at all, so $1400 (please). I declined to have the procedure to go home and do my homework. Called the insurance company to find out this was not at all the case. The crown was going to be covered, according to the insurance company and the other two crowns were not approved.
I called Jester back and all I got was, ""not sure how that happened....blah, blah,....""
Stuff happens, but seriously????? This sounds and smells like unethical behavior and unprofessional practice.....You decide. I will never go back there and you should think twice."
889,"We had, fortunately, a straightforward issue to look at and a contracted insurance company.  This at least freed us from any issues regarding waiting for labs or not knowing what it would cost.  Two things that can make a visit stressful even when everything is done right.

We were also fortunate enough to go when it wasn't busy, so we really had no wait time.  

I can say that everyone was pleasant, efficient and we were on our way with a prescription on short order."
890,"I have visited this clinic four times over the past five months. The only good experience I had was the administering of a shot on my third visit and I consider that a ""good"" experience only because I was in and out of there in about 15 minutes. I consider the people that I have interacted with very unprofessional and I would not recommend this clinic. 

My first visit was at the end of January where I had scheduled an appointment to see Dr. Wright because of fantastic reviews but I was instead seen by Dr. Leslie Gregory. Knowing that I had scheduled my appointment for a handful of reasons, some more urgent than others, I wanted to save time by entering all my information onto their portal. I was told by the nurse that it did not come through so she had to ask me all the same questions again and enter onto her tablet. Then Dr. Gregory came in and asked me all the same questions again and had to hand write the info because her tablet ""wasn't cooperating"". Doctor was quick to run some blood tests and give me an EKG for a heart murmur before getting into anything else, but I left feeling very overwhelmed and like my questions were not answered. In all, I got maybe 20 minutes with her and was told to keep a food and blood pressure journal for a week and come back. Keep in mind, I'm in my mid-twenties and don't have any severe medical conditions so I was fairly alarmed by the sense of urgency and unexpectedness I got from Dr. Gregory. Not to mention that I was not greeted or acknowledged by the front desk when I arrived which made for an unwelcoming, awkward first impression. I could also hear every single conversation the staff was having including their interoffice conflicts being hashed out right then and there. 

My second visit was the first week of February where I was to discuss the journal I had kept for a week. Seeing as technology is so prevalent in 2016, I used an app. When I pulled out my phone to show to Dr. Gregory, she showed visible frustration and slammed down her hand, exclaiming that she had ""deliberately told me to use pen and paper"". She wouldn't even look at it and I ended up leaving with even more blood tests being taken and even more concerned. She did apologize and tell me that she is frustrated that she doesn't  get enough time with patients but I felt that was very unprofessional and, again, alarming. At that point I resolved that I would not be going back for anything other than to finish out my three part vaccination. 

My third visit in April was just fine as I was there simply for shot #2 of a 3 shot series so I was in and out in about 15 minutes. My only qualm with this, is that I had to reach out to the office to find out when I needed it and was told that I ""almost missed the cutoff"" and to hurry in soon. No one ever told me when to come in after my first shot so I was a little taken aback but got it taken care of. I was very diligent to ask when I needed to come in for the third shot and was told the week of July 4th should be great. (I never did any research on my own and I am now regretful of that.)

My fourth visit was today and was a colossal waste of time. I needed to get my third (and final) administered shot so I made an appointment and showed up a few minutes early. After 20 minutes of waiting I asked ""how long"" and was told ""not much longer"" so I sat patiently. After another 20 minutes I asked again and mentioned that I was on my lunch break and even complimented them on their timeliness at my last appointment and the front desk employee got up to go ask. She came back quickly with ""what was your name again?"" which I immediately recognized as them not even knowing I was there. Another 10 minutes goes by and she gets a call from them that I'm not due for my next shot until August 15th. I told her that was incorrect and she shrugged and said ""she ran the numbers, it's august 15th."" I have yet to validate accuracy but I am working on it, either way I told her I am moving out of state on Saturday and that did not get me anywhere. Again, I could hear every conversation between staff members, including one about (presumably) one of their co-workers being in labor and ""oh! it's a boy!"". It was very clear to me that my time was not valuable to anyone in that building.

I'm incredibly upset that I will have to continue dealing with them until this is over."
891,"Victoria is awesome. She has saved my back and me!

I need to update my review.  Victoria is gone, sadly.  I'm afraid I do NOT understand these 5 star reviews for Dennis, this was no my experience.  Quite frankly, I'm a bit suspicious of all the raving reviews.  My 10-15 min adjustments did nothing. While he is adjusting me he's already trying to get me to schedule more appointments.  How bout we get through this one?  I actually left with the thought that he did not do a good adjustment just so he could get me back in.    Its speaks volumes that he has all kinds of time available and no one is ever in the waiting room.

I went home and searched for a new chiro, and thankfully she is awesome.  She is very THOUROUGH, not pushy, and listens intently.  I was in very bad shape, and could barely walk.  One adjustment with my new lady and I was already on my road to recovery.  The difference in treatment isn't even a close call."
892,"first of all, it is out of character for me to write about something so personal.  Food? No problem, but healthcare?  hmmm.. Here it goes.. (as I write this, I realize I need to write at least 3 positive reviews of other businesses so the Bad Karma doesn't stay with me long)

I've been a patient for 7 years.  Up until the 5th year, I saw the doctor twice a year, then only once a year. Looking back that's 11-13 visits.  Of those visits, there was an issue 9 times, either before the Medical assistant came out to get me or after the doctor sent me up front to make another appt or pay my bill. 

Let's talk about this visit's comedy of errors.  (Clearly I say that tongue in cheek, as I'm young and fairly competent.  I'm hoping that those who are really sick or their caregivers read this!)

2 months before appt: received a postcard with info about appt. things going well. 

4 weeks before appt: called office to inquire about rescheduling. was told that I have 2 appts scheduled with them.  one for the 7th and one for the 26th.  At this point I had to ask the person to look into why I had two appts, because clearly, she was ready to move on to her next call or task.  She then realized, that the Feb 7th appt was for LAST year.  That's right, their system doesn't make it clear to the employee what year the appt is booked for.  Boy are we on the right track, uhm...no. Fortunately, they were able to see me on the 6th.  Success, appt changed.

night before appt: received call from their IVR reminding me of next day's appt.  back on track...

day of appt: (here's where it gets good) I get to office @7:52, enter and sign in.  Front Desk Clerk (FDC) tells me that Dr is not there that day and that my appt is tomorrow.  it's early, I've been NPO (nothing consumed orally) for 12 hours, I check my calendar and assume I'v made a mistake.  I'll admit I've done that before.. shown up to the right place on the wrong date.  Shoot, I'm glad I did it when I bought my car... but that's another story.  so I go back to the car, and start searching Yelp for a place to grab some grub.  I get about 6 blocks away and who calls?  Our friend the FDC, who tells me that my appt IS today and could I come back.  OK once I get back it's about 8:11am.  my appt was at 8am.  uneventful until I get into treatment room.  Some random Caucasian lady (my doctor is a an older middle eastern man) walks in and starts asking me questions.  At which point, I'm like ""Either I'm in the wrong room or you're in the wrong room, 'cause you're not Dr. Masood"".  She then introduces herself as a new Nurse Practitioner or something like that and that she's working with Dr. Masood. OK, thanks for the clarification.  Masood finally comes in and spends, literally 3 minutes with us.  I'm told during the appt that i need a sleep study, a lab test and a follow up appt.  OK, they hand me an RX for the labs, and the MA tells me the F/U will be in 2-3 weeks.  I then clarify that the Doctor stated that the F/U should be 2-3 weeks after the sleep study.  She thinks about it for a moment and then agrees.  REALLY?  do I work here or do you?  in a later phone call she explains to me that it takes 2-3 weeks for the doctor to ""read"" the sleep study and that's why he asked for the follow up to be pushed out for so long. ( I'm actually getting exhausted again just reliving this story, but I feel that they need to be called out.  Also, I am going to copy  and past this and send it to the BBB)
As a good and diligent patient, since they didn't mention anything more about the sleep study, I figured, it was up to me to contact my insurance and do all that leg work myself.  We'll find out later this was my second incorrect assumption of the day.  My insurance provides me with a location, I contact the location and they can do it tonight.  Wait, I don't have a prescription.  That should have been my first clue.  So after a half a day of phone tag ( I was the only one playing apparently) with at least 3 CFPulmonary staff members and 2 voicemails, the nurse (actually an MA) calls me back.  This is where she explains that all i had today was a face to face meeting and that the doctor's notes needed to be written up, then documentation needs to be compiled to present to my insurance BEFORE an appt for the sleep study is made. Otherwise, I may get charged for the study.  By the way, they are happy to do the sleep study in one of their facilities, neither of which are within 15 miles of my house (the one my insurance told me about is 1.9 miles)  The MA apologizes profusely and explains the entire process to me. explanation takes about 4 minutes. Apparently, according to her, this is something that the Nurse Practitioner should have told me.  Great, that was 6  hours and 15 phone calls ago.  Thanks.


Needless to say, if you had a problem with a vendor/store 70% - 82% of the time, you'd stop patronizing them right?  Guess what I decided today?  

I hope this helps you . I'm out of space....."
893,"1. Don't park on the street. The building has underground parking for 2 bucks an hour.

2. The clinic is on the third floor. Take the elevator.

3. If you dont have MSP or other coverage, they charge 180 dollars per appointment.

4. Our waiting time was over 40 minutes on a busy Saturday afternoon.

5. Receptionists were not nasty.

6. Doctors were OK"
894,"I have been to a lot of chiropractors. Many of them are what I consider ""factory chiropractors"" in that they just try to see as many patients as humanly possible and wish to spend as little time as possible with the patient. Then they try to get you to come back one a week for... many years.

Dr. Smith is not one of these guys. If he thinks that you're done with your treatment he'll tell you. I don't need to see a chiropractor often, but when I do, I appreciate that I can get an appointment on short notice and I don't have to worry about being guilted into multiple appointments.

Highly recommended!"
895,"Did not have a pleasant experience here.  

First, after reading all the 5 star reviews, I called to make an appointment for a cleaning.  The front desk woman was condescending in her manners, not telling me whether he had openings or not.  She wanted me to tell her what type of insurance I had..  After she found out that I had the best coverage, her attitude changes completely.  Eager to book my cleaning the next day.  

At the actual cleaning, it's done by Dr. Bane himself.  I didn't feel like he gave me a cleaning at all.  just poked around my mouth.  I didn't feel anything, not a scratch anywhere, didn't feel like he got rid of any tartars.  just polishing teeth.  and took all the xrays there is in the world.  

I recently went to see another dentist for cleaning and they took off all the stuff he missed.  it was a thorough cleaning.  And I had lots of backup due to his lack of cleaning or what people on here call ""gentleness"". 

When i go get a cleaning, I want a cleaning.  Not a gentle rub.

Def would not recommend to anyone."
896,"I came to the ER after suffering a horrible dizzy spell, almost passing out, with intense nausea and gastric discomfort.  I'd been at a holiday party; but, that wasn't the cause.

I'd been taking an herbal supplement that was recommended by a professional.  I failed to do any research; and, I just started taking it for pain and to relieve some long-term bruising caused by using prednisone for an auto-immune condition.

The doctors and nurses are very caring, very professional, super informative and want you to be comfortable and to heal.  They ran blood work 3 times, an ECG and then had ECG monitoring, a CT Scan, and a chest x-ray, all because I may have had a heart attack, stroke or mini-stroke.

None of those things happened; but, I am glad they ruled them out.  I have knee surgery scheduled later in the month, so I didn't want to jeopardize that.  They did find two health concerns that I need to address; and, I will after my knee surgery.  These are long-term health improvement items; and, nothing that is acute or critical.

So glad that we were only 5 minutes away from ORMC, the ER staff was great; and, so was the hospital staff.  I really appreciate all they did for me."
897,"Walked in, talked to the ladies at the front desk after 30 minutes about why I hadn't been seen yet? Finally got seen, only to be told they would do nothing today but X-Rays and then I'd have to reschedule for cleaning and a full exam. I had told them when I made the appointment it was an emergency, as I had pain in a molar. The place was jammed, chaotic and not particularly private or clean. People working the front are rude, rude, rude and they seem to be using tattered stapled papers and index cards to manage appointments. I walked out. No thanks! What a waste of my time. I wouldn't send a homeless person there, because the homeless deserve better. How this place is licensed to provide health care, I will never know."
898,"I was there for an hour and 15 minutes before they started cleaning my teeth. I was also ""informed"" or ""advised"" by the Dental Assistant and Hygienist that based on my numbers around my gums and recession, I may need a deep clean. I am in my 40's and have never been told that before. Also, I was told I have or must have had periodontal disease and that my recession was due to this. I have never been told I had periodontal disease. Then I was told I needed to meet with a benefits coordinator to review the plan and the cost. We have government insurance and I had already verified my insurance coverage before making the appointment and my cleanings are always covered at 100%. 

When the dentist was made aware of my concerns he addressed them in a very arrogant way. In the end I did not need a deep clean and left after almost 2 hours."
899,"The professionalism in the way this office is ran is incredibly subpar.  My first visit was a year ago just for a standard skin assessment/checkup.  Apparently the office was having issues with their AC and it was 80+ degrees inside.  Unbearable.  Instead of cancelling appointments, they chose to proceed with taking patients.  I wanted to pass out in the room.  They were nice enough to offer a bottle of water though, were kind, and I get it...sometimes crap happens.  I just went with it.  I felt like my examination was rushed and was in and out in a very short amount of time.  As a new patient, I didnt feel like the tech attempted to get to know my skin history/health at all.  Fast forward to TODAY, 2020.  I had an appointment at 8am (that was booked a year ago on my first visit).  I received multiple auto-recording reminders the day prior.  I got up early, drove thru traffic to get to my appointment at 7:45am (per instructions).  I get there today and the front desk agent is confused and tells me that the tech I have the appointment with today isn't in today and shes confused at why the appointment was made and asked if I wanted her to call a different office location so I could then drive THERE to meet with whatever tech happened to be working there today.  I declined.  She offered to reschedule which I did but have since cancelled that.  I dont trust the way this office operates.  Its 2020 get a scheduling tool."
900,"The winter blues are the worst!! When I set my appointment I was told that that visit would be 30 -40 mins tops. The only appointment available was in the middle of my work day. Or wait weeks. I took it. On my lunch Break I went ... When I arrived and smelled urine, I knew something was not right. After filling out my paperwork and waiting 1 hour Beyond my appointment time, decided to ask "" how much longer.. the sweet take in person squeezed in when another patient ran to that restroom. Thankful, the Dr had to take a call whilst I sat there. It was only 5 or 7 mins. ( I paid for my visit.. over $100). The Dr was pleasant. Asked good questions. My visit was all of 10 mins + the 7 mins he was on the call. I essentially got what I needed. But will consider if I need to come back to this office. I feel I'm not a good fit. You be that judge."
901,"I would give this place ZERO STARS if it was an option. My husband went there back in the winter and had his cleaning and was told he needed two cavities filled. They made no mention of what insurance would pay so my husband didn't think anything of it as they typically collect day of the appointment. When he arrived to have his cavities filled, he went straight back and had the procedure done. They used so much numbing medication that he was delirious when he left and people at work were concerned about him. Also, during the procedure a metal piece was dropped into his mouth and he had to spit it out so as not to choke. They asked for no payment that day and made no mention of an out of pocket cost. Considering they typically require same day payment, my husband went on his way. Cue 2 months later when we receive a bill for $415. Upon further inquiry, we were informed that insurance doesn't cover the type of filling they use so we had to pay out of pocket for the entire procedure. Upon speaking with my insurance company, they say they do cover fillings but not white fillings. When I called and spoke with Edward, he sent me the insurance claim and stated he would call the next day at 3pm to discuss it and a possible reduced rate. I never received the call from Edward (this was April 26) and didn't hear from the office again until early August when they sent a bill stating we were over 60 days late in payment. I emailed Edward on August 4th and did not receive a response. Yesterday Aug 17, 14 days after we received a notice that we were 60 days over due (mind you my husband had this procedure in early winter), we received another notice stating we were over 90 days due and they will be sending it to a collection agency in ten days if unpaid. The office called my husband and he spoke with them today. The head admin woman stated they typically collect payment day of so she is unsure why they didn't and why he wasn't informed. I would NEVER go here again and would NEVER recommend them to anyone. Also, I went to my dentist for two white fillings-$280 and these guys charge $415, massively expensive. DON'T GO THERE!!! So many other better places in Boston"
902,Horrible place. Was completely lied to by the doctor and her staff! Very disappointed. I was quoted one price for my procedure and by the time all was said and done I was charged $300 more than the original price of $824. This is more than some people make in a week and is just so mean to do to anyone! I would understand a few hidden charges of $50 or even $100 but $300 is just bad business and shows this place could care less about you! Even my insurance company couldn't believe that I was completely lied to and tried contacting the office 3 times with zero success. Please don't make the same mistake I did and choose this dentist. Unfortunately I learned the hard way!
903,"I am going to try to be fair with this review by just saying the facts.  I came here for fertility and menstrual cycle questions along with wanting my annual pap smear.  I got an appointment about 3 months away from the day that I called.  I went in for my appointment and I was put in a room.  I could over hear Dr. Cofield yelling about me, a new patient, ""DOES SHE WANT A PAP SMEAR OR FERTILITY HELP?  ONE OR THE OTHER!""  The nurse came in and asked - so I chose fertility questions.  I got referrals for 3 places including 1 for my husband.  We made an appointment for a check up on all these tests for a month later.  We did our due diligence and paid hundreds on these tests.  We were ready to hear the results and talk to the doctor about their meaning.  I come in and I was told by nurse that she thought this was the pap smear appointment.   Ugh.  She then says there is nothing they can do or even talk about at this point. This made no sense to me, so I waited for the Doctor Who then explained the test which I wanted. It turns out that the physician's assistant had told me all the wrong things on the phone about the tests and gave us really negative results, when the doctor explained them, we weren't in such bad shape. She then told me that she would recommend seeing an endocrinologist for an exact pill that she noted that she could prescribe, but she wanted me to go get a referral to see an endocrinologist and pay extra anyway. It is a pill that is known to help people with what I have. I then make an appointment with an endocrinologist and I read into the office and ask for a referral, and the physician's assistant acts like I'm crazy asking for a referral. The doctor did recommend a specific endocrinologist but of course my insurance didn't cover it so I found one that did.  I also have to wait another 3 months at this point and time is ticking. I've talked to you plenty of people who have gone to a gynecologist because I am kind of new to the whole thing and they said it was ridiculous that she wouldn't talk to me about anything after the pap smear and acted like she had to charge me for every little thing that I did. I should have known right away when she was yelling in the office that I should have walked right out. The kicker is that I didn't get a bill for a consultation visit for $250 in the mail for my first appointment, I believe. I'm not sure if they charge me for two pap smears which is not covered I don't know what, but it didn't make sense. Especially when she took about 5 minutes to talk to me. Absolutely. Ridiculous. I would not recommend for a caring fertility or doctor by any stretch of the imagination."
904,"As a first time client I was a little nervous coming in. But the moment I walked in I was very pleased and happy with the whole experience. I want to thank Ariana the receptionist who reccomened me here and who was a huge help throughout the whole proccess from location details and helping me with the forms. The whole staff was amazing and welcoming! Excellent job Dr Cindy.
For anyone in search for a new dental office definitely look into 2nd & Madison Dental!"
905,"Dr. Van and her staff was very knowledgeable about the ear piercing process. The office was clean and they followed the COVID19 procedures checking temperature, mask and social distancing. The nurse placed numbing cream on my infant ears immediately after taking her temperature and took a copy of the tetanus immunization. Dr. Van was very through and explained the process, healing and aftercare. My 7month old was very comfortable with Dr.Van as she marked her ears and pierced them quickly and efficiently. My infant was smiling after the procedure. Post 4wks and my lo is doing great haven't had any issues with her ears. I highly recommend Dr.Van! Last but not least, the front office receptionist was very friendly and pleasant. Im so happy that I found BeeWell and Dr.Van!"
906,"I went to see nurse Kelly a few years back for botox and was very impressed. She took more time analyzing my face before injecting than anyone had before. Usually it is a stick and run operation. I went back to her again for botox and juvederm to plump up my cheeks. I previously had juvederm injected in my cheeks by Dr. Nick at Westlake dermatology with very minimal injection pain and very good results. The juvederm experience with Nurse Kelly was torturous. She kept injecting one side of my cheek over and over and the other side very few injections. Needless to say I looked like I had a golf ball on one side of the face. She said to let the swelling go down and come back if it wasn't looking right and she would fix it. I went back a few weeks later with my golf ball face and she injected one side of my face with the stuff that makes the juvederm dissolve. She said fillers are not a perfect science. Ah yes I know. I also know if you shoot one side of the face a bunch and the other side a few times you will look like a freak. I went back again a few weeks after that so she could try and even my face out again. I will give this to them they gave it their best college try free of charge to make it right. However, I would not recommend Nurse Kelly doing juvederm in the cheeks."
907,"Dr. L is great, but the nurse staff has been killing me over the last month. I'm not sure what changed, but I have to wait over 20 minutes every time I go in to get my shots now, something that didn't occur before and I've been seeing them for well over a year. On top of that, there is only one nurse that gives me shots that makes them not hurt. The nurses that travel from other offices to fill in never look at my chart and I constantly have to remind them to check the notes on the computer about where to administer the shots, even though the screen is right in front of them. They also don't make effort to find the little soft spots on my arms where you are supposed to give the shots so they hurt less. They are just lazy about it, and I'm almost in tears every time I get my shots from them. I'm not sure how the nurses are trained, but I would suggest they have a campfire chat on how to be better with customer service and be more gentle. If one of the nurses, the one from Boston who's name has slipped my mind, can make the shots not burn and not make my arm sore for days, the other nurses should take note."
908,"I'd been going to Dr Lally for a few years and was very pleased.  When she moved to her trendy new hipster digs, I continued to see her.  However, I had an appointment for a cleaning when she was not in, and that's when the tables turned.  I did not realize that I had a terrible case of thrush due to being on antibiotics.  Neither the dental hygienist who cleaned my teeth nor the backup dentist for Dr. Lally noticed it.  It wasn't until I got home and looked at my teeth that I realized they had overlooked a really terrible case of thrush.  I sent an email to Dr. Lally's office stating I wanted to discuss this with Dr. Lally, but got a generic return email from her receptionist.  When I replied that I wanted to talk with Dr. Lally, she did eventually call me, but at that point I had lost my confidence in her office.  I'm so sorry that I had this experience.  Up until then, I did consider Dr. Lally's office to be a good one."
909,"Dr. McCool is not only an excellent physician, but she is a genuinely caring, compassionate and nurturing person! I have been struggling with my weight and Type II diabetes for approximately 10 years. After meeting with Dr. McCool during recent visits, she suggested that an HCG protocol may be the answer to my weight issues and poorly managed diabetes. I had cycled through several pharmaceuticals that always gave me undesirable side effects with minimal results at best. I was very frustrated and was beginning to feel hopeless about my situation and future. My quality of life was gradually dissipating, and I knew my future was heading down a dangerous path. It was then when I finally realized I desperately needed to take a different approach and reached out to Dr. McCool for help!  After listening to Dr. McCool's advice and researching HCG on my own, I decided to take her medical advice and started the HCG protocol.  She was with me every step of the way on this new journey! While at times I held onto my doubts due to the constant struggle over the last decade, I'm pleased to report that after just five weeks, I have lost 25 lbs. (and still losing), and over 20"" off my body!  I have not had to take any of my diabetic meds, and I now have the best control over my blood sugars I have seen since I was diagnosed with the life-threatening disease! With the guidance, encouragement and support of Dr. McCool I can honestly tell you that I have a new lease on life! I went from wearing size 38-40 to a 34 waist size.  Last weekend I went through my closet and joyfully discarded over half of my wardrobe. Aside from marrying my loving wife of sixteen years and the birth of my two sons, this was the best day of my adult life! My body has responded beautifully and my blood sugars are tightly controlled naturally with none of the nasty side effects I was challenged to live with day-to-day! I finally fee free again to now focus on other interests in life:) I have just started down an amazing new journey, and I have Dr. McCool to thank! My family and friends could not be happier (and I must admit that the compliments are nice too).  Whether you are struggling with a serious ailment, or just want to live a healthier and happier life, I highly recommend you give Dr. McCool a call."
910,"I am new to the Georgia area. I have been to three of Piedmonts facilities and have had the best care during my visits and procedures. I just don't understand how a critical facility can charge you and your family to park. If you happen to be low on cash while going to Piedmont Atlanta and  on a fixed income, you might add to the stress of your illness begging to have your parking validated."
911,"Where to start......
I started going here because my insurance referred me and was 100% covered.  I hadn't gone to the dentist in quite some time and figured now is the time!  When I first walked in to the Tualitin office the staff seemed nice and helpful but not very informative.  I waited for about 45 minutes with nobody checking on me just to get my teeth cleaned.  Quickly I realized how unfriendly the staff was-when it was time to clean my teeth someone came in wo a word and started adjusting my chair and shoving a very uncomfortable piece of plastic (that cut my gums) for an X-ray.  I didn't know what was going on.  Anyway.....I ended up needing quite a few cavities filled and every time I went there it was a HORRIBLE experience.  They put so much Novocain in my mouth so I wouldn't feel the massive holes they were drilling.  Since this 3 of my cavities have fallen out, within 3 months-one of them twice.   I have never had so much mouth pain and sensitivity until after I started coming here.  It does not seem very sanitary-maybe they do a very quick job between customers but I really doubt it.  I honestly do not know where these hygienist come, no personality and rude as can be.  I had said I wanted to be sedated since it had been so long since I was at the dentist I was very nervous and sweaty and my anxiety was thru the roof but they didn't care and did nothing to calm my nerves.  I have gone to the Tualitin office as well as the one off Broadway near Lloyd Center and they are both the same.  Dr.  Sedaka is nice, he was super nice my first visit and has kinda gone down hill with me.  I have also had the girl dentist (forgot her name) and she maybe said 4 words to me the whole time.   And this isn't even saying anything about the receptionist!!  They are SO RUDE!!  Every single one of them!!  I recently started having really bad sensitive tooth pain on one of my K9s and asked the lady if she could tell me if it was the one that was filled before she pretty much laughed and asked how should she know? Really?!?! aren't my records there?? So I needed to make an apt asap to get this fixed and she made a big sigh and says they are only open every other saturday and certain days of the week and the next time she had open was close to a week away....whatever I'll go to Lloyd center cause this needs to get done....she hangs up transfers me over so all a sudden there is a new lady on the phone and she's even worse!!  I asked her how long my apt would be and her answer was pathetic and RUDE I ended up hanging up on her and have decided to NEVER GO HERE AGAIN!  I would rather pay and not be covered then to put another penny in this dentist office's pocket!!  TAKE MY WORD FOR IT.....YOU WILL BE DISSAPOINTED!!!"
912,"The office is very impressive. Massage chair, lots of bling. After a very fast ultrasonic cleaning (no hand scaling) and an extensive set of X-rays, and an exam detailing how I needed tons of work done on my mouth, I was taken in to a private office (closing room) with an estimate. My insurance company had already been consulted and I needed to come up with several thousands of dollars or I was in big trouble...my insurance company was denying coverage on some of the work.I was given a bizarre ""goodie"" bag and sent on my way. I say bizarre because it included items more cosmetic in nature, like the lotions in a hotel room.

I left the office very upset with my insurance company and afraid of the work needed on my teeth that I couldn't afford. I received phone calls from this dentist regularly and the hard sell was creeping me out...had a bad feeling about this dentist. A year and 9 months later a crown fell out of a molar so I made an appointment with a modest office out of the downtown area that could get me in right away. They had excellent reviews...father/daughter set up. She reseated my crown and said after looking at the X-rays they had just done, that everything else looked great. Needless to say, I was relieved and surprised. They made an appointment to get me in for routine cleaning and sent me on my way. 

I would not recommend Dental Dynamics."
913,My 2 months old baby had fever and we went to this hospital to the emergency room. Their staffs tried to find my little ones vein with 6 different nurses and doctors. They tried for 3 hours but they were unsuccessful. My little angel was in serious pain during this time and cried badly. Finally they sent my baby to Boston children's hospital with ambulance. They tried just once and find my baby's vein. This hospital just tried to keep my baby to charge us and our insurance. They don't have any professionals for babies . I will never come back to this hospital again. If you love your babies please don't go to this hospital.
914,"Simply the BEST!  
Rob is *the* most knowledgeable person 
I've ever spoken to about tattoo removal...
and I had my tattoo treated at MGH.

I came in *after* being scarred in an MGH study, 
involving 3-4 back to back, same day, laser treatments.
My tattoo is only half gone...after doing this 3 painful times.

Rob, the owner of Disappearing Inc.,
which I can now recommend as an Tattoo Removal EXPERT,
told me my scarring was the ""most severe I've ever seen."" 
He also informed me I had the right to request treatment for it.

In addition to his extension knowledge and patience,
as he met with me for an HOUR for FREE,
he also has integrity and honesty too...
alerting me to the fact that lasers might not work well 
on my badly scarred skin, and the scarring might get worse.
He DID offer to treat me, despite my skin's condition,
but he wanted to be sure I was aware that it might not work.

THE DEAL:  Rob is the guy you want behind your Boston 
laser tattoo removal treatment:  smart, honest and kind.
He is simply the best Boston tattoo removal expert."
915,"I've been a patient if Rose Dental for a few years. Ita been a mixed experience.

They have a very clean and modern facility and equipment. Generally they're pretty skilled dentists and hygienists, but again, I've never had any real dental work done beyond routine cleaning and xrays.

The staff are cordial but not personable or friendly. I think it takes a lot more than fancy equipment to be a medical facility I'd highly recommend, and Rose Dental does not live up. They do not give off a sense that they care very much about their patients. 

There have been numerous examples of this over the years, but here is the most recent: I had a 7am appointment on Nov 12. I showed up but no staff ever did. It wasn't until the door still wasn't unlocked at 7am that I realized I had received a phone call at 6:30am saying it was too cold for the staff and they wouldn't be in until 10am. I don't get phone calls at that time of day so I missed it though I was already driving over by that time; that's my fault. But the forecast hadn't changed in over 24 hours and it was merely a little chilly (about 30°); there was no rain/snow/ice on the road. There was no reason to imagine the office would be closed. It's pretty inexplicable that they couldn't have decided they would close due to chilly temps the previous business day. Patients are expected to give 24 hours notice or pay a penalty. It seems only reasonable the office would play by the same rules. 

It's just a lot of little annoyances like this from this group - the way they treat you makes you feel like you're just not important at all. I'm hoping to find a dentist who makes the experience a little more warm and pleasant."
916,"This was by far the absolute worst experience I have EVER had with a doctor.  The only thing I enjoyed while being here was leaving.  

From the beginning, the technician was distant and unpleasant.  I felt like a number, not a person.  I was never asked what my symptoms, instead she took my vitals and left the room with a ""doctor will be with you shortly on her way out"".  

Then, the doctor came in.  He never introduced himself, so I can't tell you who to avoid.  His bedside manner was absolutely horrible.  The first thing he asked was ""What's wrong with you?"" When I explained what was wrong, he simply brushed it off and said there was nothing he could do for me.  I never even received an examination.  I tried to keep my frustrations down.  After explaining that I was in serious pain, he told me he could maybe give me a shot.  This was not what I needed.  I just told him to call in a prescription for some medication and told him what I needed.  Just like the technician, he was distant and cold.  It was extremely unpleasant.

After leaving MedSpring, I went home to wait for my prescription to be filled.  After waiting for over two hours, I went to Walgreens to pick up my prescription.  Of course, it was never called in.  At this point, I was absolutely furious.  When the pharmacist asked who my doctor was and I told them MedSpring she just shook her head and said ""you'll have to call and remind them, they usually take a very long time to call in a prescription"".  This is unacceptable.  After being on hold with MedSpring for over 20 minutes, John finally answered the phone.  He was very friendly and understanding and said that he would find out why my prescription was not ready.  The others could learn from him.  

Overall, if you go to MedSpring, you will be overcharged to diagnose yourself and not have your prescription taken care of.  

It's Austin, you can easily find somewhere better for Urgent Care and I highly recommend you do.  

Overall, I was overcharged to self-diagnose myself to a doctor and to wait in line at Walgreens. I would highly recommend going somewhere else."
917,"Find somewhere else for medical care.  I waited, literally, for hours to get some anti-nausea medicine for diving, and although I told them that on the phone and when I arrived, they made me wait to see a doctor so he culd tell me that he could not prescribe this drug for diving because it might make me drowsy.  What a waste of time and money!"
918,I had the Venus treatment before my wedding. The cost was $1500. What a waste of time and money!!! I actually have pictures to prove it. I politely asked to talk with the manager 2 times ( I physically walked in) and they didn't even have the professional courtesy to see me or call me back! The only person that was polite to me was the receptionist. I'm SOL!
919,"I really wanted to like this place, because I do not believe the the ER is necessary for every off hours problem. But unfortunately, they took our money, did not do a thorough job, gave concerns to my teenage daughter and then gave us the wrong instructions so that we ended up at the ER anyway!!

My daughter cut her foot on a rusty pipe in a locker room. The staff at the school bandaged it very well. We were taken quickly at Doctors Express Waltham. the nurse who undid the bandage remarked what a great job the high school staff had done. She gave it a good look and cleaned it again. 

Then the doctor came in. She was very friendly, but she did not inspire confidence. She barely looked at it - a glance without turning the foot to even see where the cut was deepest. She quickly proclaimed that all we could do was glue it. She went to get the glue and my daughter wondered why she did not wear any ""clean""gear over her street clothes. 

Then after she put the gloves on to do the glue, she used her gloved hands to push her hair back out of her face and behind her head!!! What?! Why didn't she have her hair in a rubber band if it gets in her way? And why didn't she change her gloves after that move? The glue was globbed on. It stung. She said to let it ry for 40 seconds and put the sock back on. She gave my daughter a tutorial in what to look for by way of infection, and warned her not to used any creams or antiseptic ointments on the glue, as it would dissolve. 

We asked if she could get it wet and the answer was YES. The discharge instructions - which were the instructions for many things all on one page (very bad way to go) - also said you could shower. 

2 hours later, 2 minutes in the shower and it was gone! Blood everywhere. We went to Newton Wellesley. I highly recommend NW hospital. They told us immediately that these glues need 24 - 48 hours without getting wet. The looked at it thoroughly, cleaned it, glued it in ultra thin strips, drying between each like you do paint, covered it in steri strips in a cross hatch pattern, covered it with a waterproof bandage, wrapped it for extra protection and offered crutches. Yes, it seems like overkill, but stepping on it and any pressure will increase the odds of opening and longer healing. So now we are set.

My teen noticed the lack of appropriate procedures on the part of the doctor. She was afraid from the second we left Doctor's Express. This doctor not only broke protocol, but in doing so and in not looking at the wound gave us a complete lack of confidence that was then borne out when the whole thing fell apart soon after. What a waste of time and money! 

I am not against all urgent cares, just this one!"
920,"One star for the awesome receptionist. Came here after being referred by a nurse at work. Went to the health room at work due to back problems. Nurse took my vitals and informed me that I had hbp and fever. She gave me Tylenol to control my fever and told me to visit urgent care after work just to make sure everything was okay since it's going to take a while if I would have to schedule an appointment with my primary care because of the holiday. 

I hate hospitals. I rarely visit my doctor because most of the times I get sick, I can control it. And also because I just have really bad experiences with doctors. For example, I've seen 3 obgyns regarding my menstrual irregularity and all 3 had different diagnosis. 

Anyways, I debated about visiting urgent care but I trusted the nurse at work. I didn't really care about the fever or hbp because they're controllable. I was just worried about my back. I've had back problems in the past but It wasn't as bad as this current one. So basically I've been in pain for nearly a whole month. My awesome doctor asked me a couple of yes or no questions, clicked some stuff on the computer and diagnosed me with sprain to the lower back. And this was all done without any examinations. 

I guess what I'm disappointed about is that, I wasted my time. Earlier that day, my co worker, who has absolutely no medical education, diagnosed me with the same thing using process of elimination AND web md :) (im definitely going to refer her for a job at that clinic) I was hoping for a definite answer or at least some exams, an x ray or something just to try and see exactly what is going on instead of just an assumption based on a couple of yes or no questions. Oh and when I told my awesome doctor about a fever I had earlier, he discredited my nurse at work saying she might not know what a fever is. Disgrace. 

Just a tip for anyone reading this. Always  research the doctor and the clinic before visiting. Lesson learned. Never again."
921,"I've been having these random intermittent issues with my right foot so I finally decided to get a foot doctor to check out. My physician took a look the last time this happened and tested me for gout, which it wasn't. I needed a last minute appointment and was so glad when someone picked up in this office and was able to get me an appointment for the same afternoon. The appointment person was very friendly and professional. I was excited to go in for my appointment and see what was going on with my foot. 
When I arrived the parking was a little confusing and I was taken aback to see that the lot charges $5 for an hour. I parked and got on the garage elevator. I pressed the floor with the * thinking that it would take me to the level I needed to go to enter the office but I actually should have gotten off on 2. That was annoying but ok.

I walked into the office (420) and there was a little but if a wait to give them my information. No problem. It happens. Still just thankful to be seen same day. My appointment was fir 245, they called me back around 320. $46 later ($40 copay plus $6 parking cause they don't validate) it turns out that I may just need to wear bigger shoes. I appreciate the doctor not recommending any unnecessary expensive treatments.

DR. nooman was cool. The staff is ok, not much of a sense of urgency but they're not rude, and the parking was annoying. I should've just valetd for $7. Best part was the appointment making experience. I'll probably come back if the problem continues."
922,"DO NOT GO SEE THIS PHYSICIAN. She is highly condescending, close-minded, incapable of empathy, and does not value her patients' perceptions, experiences, and concerns. Do NOT trust Dr. Scumpia with your care - thyroid, diabetes, metabolic disorders, etc. Her knowledge is antiquated and her ""care"" is driven by egocentric mechanisms rather than treating patients humanely and respectfully. Her and her staff are the worst medical providers I have encountered in 10 years since being diagnosed with Hashimoto's and living in 5 cities."
923,"I found Dr. Campaigne and Liane when they were both still at OBGYN North and I was pregnant for the second time, preparing to attempt a vbac. I will never forget how Dr. C sat and talked with my husband and I about the complications from my previous pregnancy and my chances for a successful vbac for a full 45 minutes - then gave me a big hug when I broke down in tears at the thought of another premature baby. 

When I found out she had left OBGYN North I kind of freaked out, but I was thrilled to find that she and Liane (who is so awesome and has the most soothing, friendly personality ever) had formed their own practice. I followed them for my third pregnancy and it was just a fantastic experience. Every visit is so personal - they asked about my life and cared about my answers. Dr. Campaigne remembered that I had a difficult time adjusting emotionally after the birth of my second, and spent a lot of time talking with me about the steps I was taking to ease the transition to three. Towards the end of my pregnancy I started getting really stressed out about the possibility of more complications like in my first, and she and Liane basically held my hand through crying breakdowns and made a point to get test results back to me asap so I wouldn't have to worry. 

My child's birth was perfect, and knowing that the person delivering my son into the world was a friend, in addition to being my doctor, was so special. Both Dr. C and Liane came to my room the next day to sit and listen to me tell the whole story again, and Dr. C even came to do a home visit a couple weeks later, just checking to see how things were going. 

Seriously, this place is amazing. The doctor, the midwife, and every single member of the staff has such a caring attitude. The level of care is fantastic, as they take the time to really listen and pay attention to you. I am trying to convince my husband that I need to get pregnant again just so I can visit them more often."
924,"The front staff DEFINITELY needs watering. No smiles or chitchat even with me trying to help them out with that. 

The back staff seems to be quite similar. You can't really conversate with instruments in your mouth, but she could have at least answered my questions other than one word responses. 

Dr. Ho is nice, he was informative enough for my satisfaction, however after treatment, I wish he would have stayed in the room until the RDA got everything out of my mouth - I had a few questions. 

After my mouth was cleared of tools and saliva the RDA informed me I was done and took my chart away while I gathered myself back together. Do I stay here? Is the doctor coming back? Do I leave the room? Are you going to wipe my mouth? 

Who knows. I didn't see her again, so I left. 

I'll probably be back solely because it's affordable and adequate. NOT because I love it."
925,"During my appointment with Dr. Henke, he told me that surgery would be needed for my broken ankle. He also started to talk to me about taking vitamins regularly, which seemed odd and unrelated until he mentioned that his wife sells Advocare (expensive supplements sold in a pyramid scheme format). Dr. Henke then tried to get me to purchase Advocare from his wife (who is not in the medical field) and gave me all of her information.  

The night before my surgery I just started to feel nervous about it, so I canceled and got three other opinions from orthopedic doctors who all said that the only reason I would need surgery was if my bones were not aligned, which they are. Therefore, the surgery was not necessary. Overall, he was very nice during my visit, but the whole experience made me feel a little taken advantage of and mistrusting of him and his practice."
926,"I would have given 0 stars, but the dentist was actually a nice guy. They have a payment policy that requires that you pay before seeing the doctor which is ridiculous. It shows where the practices priorities are. the xray I received was from an ancient panoramic device that probably exposed me to tons of radiation. This office didn't have the new low raisin digital devices. I think they were trying to save money with equipment. I got a paraffin hand treatment which had nothing to do with my teeth. And I got tons of anesthesia injected by a dental assistant with no doctor present during my teeth cleaning. I'm not sure that's even legal. I think they spent most of their start up money on decorating their office. And the staff was horribly rude and obnoxious."
927,"I have had the misfortune of my life of having 19 surgeries. From my back to my knees my hands and my foot.   I've dealt with dozens of doctors and I've never ever met anyone like Dr. Jones from Town Center Foot Clinic.  He is truly compassionate, kind and he truly cares about his patients.   I don't want this to be a generic review of "" he's a great doctor.""  I never write reviews. I just have never been into that. But Dr. Jones is so different than any doctor I've ever had I had to write a review  for him.   

 I had foot surgery in  2016 to have a cystic tumor  removed from my foot. My recovery has been horribly painful due to complications that were the fault of my body not my doctor.  It's at this time that I believe you really find out how great your doctor is. Through all of my pain and truly the agony of recovering from my surgery Dr. Jones has been right there. And I mean always right there for me. He makes you feel like you're the only patient he has. 

I don't care   If my life takes me all the way to Seattle or all the way to California in the future, I will make the drive to see Dr. John's because he's simply the best doctor I've ever had in my entire life.   Compassion, kindness, empathy and extremely intelligent this doctor is the best doctor I believe you'll ever have. Look no further than Dr.  Paul Clint Jones of Town Center Foot Clinic... It'll be the best move  you'll ever make if you have toe, foot or ankle problems."
928,"I had a disappointing experience at SmartCare. The staff was friendly and the facility was very nice but those are the only good things I can say about my experience. I had to wait more than 2 hours to be seen (and there was only 2 patients in the office before me). I only saw the doctor for approximately 60 seconds in total. I came in for a foot injury and the doctor didn't even touch my foot. After getting an X-Ray, a new nurse came in the room to tell me just to put ice on my foot and take tylenol when I get home, with me still not knowing my diagnoses. 

I understand this is an urgent care facility and they may not be concerned with building relationships but this was just a terrible experience all the way around. A complete waste of time and money."
929,"ALERT!!!!!! I Went to see dr. Van orman for a cleaning... His cleaning was very quick and didn't seem efficient. I had a filling that came out and he told me I was borderline needing a root canal and recommended a crown, and deep gum cleaning as he said I had bone loss, which I found peculiar because I keep up on my cleaning. He stated I had 4 additional cavities that needed filling and gave me a treatment plan at the end of my appointment stating I had needed close to 4K in dental work done. He offered me a 20% cash discount because I don't have dental insurance, seems like a great deal right??? Not so much!! A week later I had a tooth in the very front chip just a lil bit so I went to a different dentists who could squeeze me in before my vacation to fix the small chip, I told her what I was told by dr van orman and gave her permission to my exam, treatment plan and x rays from his practice. Come to find out I need nothing Dr. Van orman claimed I needed. The crown he claimed I needed was 1500$ when really all I needed was a filling 300$ the 4 cavities he claimed that  I had were non-existing. This Dr. Is very unprofessional and a scam artist. He caused me so much stress thinking I needed all this work done and financial despair. I will be reporting him to the better business bureau as I hope he won't continue to get away with this!!!Good riddance. DO NOT GIVE HIM YOUR BUSINESS!!!!"
930,"Do not come here unless you don't care about getting quality service. I came here for a regular eye exam but the Dr who was doing my exam realized I actually have scratched corneas and my eyes are very inflamed. He gave me some steroid drops along with very specific instructions to come back weekly for an update. 

The 2nd time I saw him, I came right at 11am when the store opened because that was when my appointment was. This is where everything started to go downhill. I approached the women at the front and said, ""Hi, I have an appointment at 11 with Dr Cheung."" One of the women looked up at me, she made eye contact, and after I introduced myself, she looked away and turned her back towards me. I had no words to describe how incredibly rude and unprofessional this was. You might be thinking, ""maybe she doesn't work there"". Then why was she the one who opened the gates and put the sign up outside? 

Dr Cheung scheduled me for my 3rd follow up appointment but he did warn me he would not be in that day but another Dr would see me. I really liked Dr Cheung - I found him very helpful and caring about my eye situation. So I came for my 3rd follow up appointment, knowing full well that I would be seeing another Dr. He told me if I run out of the drops before my 4th appointment, I can just come in ANY TIME WITHOUT MAKING AN APPOINTMENT to get a refill prescription. That is exactly what I did and guess what! The staff who was working that day told me I needed to see a Dr to get the refill prescription and that there was no Dr in  that day. This would not be a problem but I am on a very strict schedule with my drops. I was already out of drops and because they were steroids, I can't just stop them abruptly and wait FOUR DAYS to see Dr Cheung!! I wish the Dr I saw on May 5th advised me it is best I make an appt ahead of time to get a re-fill to ensure I get it. THANK GOODNESS my pharmacy gave me an emergency refill after I explained the situation to her!! 

Today was the last straw. I came back for my 4th appt, hoping this would be the last one because I am almost done my medication. The Dr I saw, Dr. Michael Ing was... bluntly put, unprofessional, DIRTY, and didn't take me seriously. He didn't do a full exam to make sure my corneas were healed and that the prescription I was getting today was fully updated. Here's the big thing: HE DIDN'T SANITIZE ANY OF THE EQUIPMENT I HAD TO PUT MY FACE/EYES TO DURING THE ""EXAM"". The equipment had a faint smell of I don't even want to know, he didn't sanitize his hands, and he didn't care to review my file before starting my appointment. He was atrocious. ABSOLUTELY DISGUSTINGLY ATROCIOUS. I wish I could put into words to describe HOW DIRTY this Dr. looked. I have had my fair share of visits to hospitals and clinics. I'm sorry but I expect medical professionals to be well kept, CLEAN, hygienic and professional. 

Speaking of sanitizing, the staff members who does a preliminary check on you before seeing the Dr. didn't sanitize the equipment either!!! Are these women even properly trained to work in an optometry office?! 

I am glad this happened at the tail end of my medication. I will be going back to my regular clinic at Metrotown where everyone has actual customer service skills, CLEAN AND HYGIENIC HABITS,  AND REAL DOCTORS. This may be a super long review but these are my eyes we're talking about and if the Dr says your corneas are badly scratched and inflamed, you are going to expect quality service and medical advice from a real professional who will make sure you heal properly!!! If I could give Dr Cheung a five star review, I would. He was the only reason I continued to return until today. But If i'm just going to be passed around like a baseball, NO THANKS."
931,"Never go to this place.!!! I think you risk alot if you go to this place. They keep my brother in to long and would not let him out and treated him real bad. We think because he was gay. We will have to see a lawyer to get him out of this place it seems.And they would not let us see my brother..He has cancer and needed us. Doctors promised him he would get out, but they would not let him out, and even pink shipped him because he got upset, when they would not let him out.This does not seem like a good place at all. They tried to fix my mom's boyfriends heart but messed up and he had a stroke and was never right again and died in a nursing home.To where, if he had went some place else he would not had had the stroke and would be alive today.This is what I think. Don't trust this place..If you want to live a free life or if you just want to live. I could not even see my family tonight..!! I cried and cried..This place is out for money..This is the worse place you can go to. My brother was treated so bad.They actionally had cops to keep us from seeing my brother. They would not let him lieve even know the doctors said he could and the doors was lucked and we could not get in to check on my brother.. He was so upset..They was so rude and mean and they only upset my brother more. Cancer grows when people get upset and they really messed my brother up.They really don't seem to treat people right.And we think it was because my brother WAS GAY AND HAD AIDS..!!"
932,"Clean but unprofessionally behind schedule most of the time. I have frequent appointments for Invisalign where I usually wait a minimum of a half hour, usually more, to be seen when I show up for my scheduled appointment. Their staff is constantly turning over, I have been here under my parents insurance upwards of two years now and I usually start seeing completely new staff every 6-8 months."
933,"Several years ago I had some really bad experiences with service at EyeHealth Northwest and swore I'd never return. My eye doctor was wonderful, but the support staff and systems created some odd problems. I ended up going to a couple of other eye clinics in the interim, but then decided to give them another try largely because I liked my doctor and it was convenient to home and the other one I went to prior to returning had closed down. I'm late in updating my prior bad review since I've been back to EyeHealth Northwest a couple of times since then, but I did want to correct it to say that they have resolved their problems and I've had very good experiences with staff and processes since I've returned as a patient, and would definitely recommend them."
934,"(You'll be a dentist! You have a talent for causing things pain!)

For years, I avoided going to the dentist, for one reason or another. Just couldn't do it. I knew it had to be done. So easy to find excuses not to go.

I finally went to Hanle a few years ago, since both my dad and step-mom went to him and recommended the gentle touch.

(Here he is, folks, the leader of the plaque!)

The first cleaning was not terrific, but I guess that's my fault. They did what they had to do. One of the assistants did all the gritty sandpaper toothpaste stuff, and then Hanle came in and checked on me. He was nice and gentle, even though I feared what he would say waiting so long to go back to the dentist.

(I'm your dentist. And I get off on the pain I inflict.)

I've been back for several cleanings since the initial one.

Not all that long ago, I felt an awful pain in a tooth. I called and got in almost immediately. Turns out I had to get a root canal. (Yee-haw!)

(And when I start extracting those molars, You girls will be scaring like Holy Rollers)

I never knew it was a several-visit ordeal.  He did a good job of explaining what had to be done.

I gladly took the gas they offered. It was enough to make things okay. And the numbing, well, it makes all the pain not there.  I was sore for a bit afterwards, but not so much on the spot of the canal, but the jaw muscles. 

('Cause I'm a dentist... And a success!)

If you're in search of a dentist, I highly recommend him. The office staff has always been very friendly and his assistants are nice as well, and help alleviate the many fears we all have.

And, no, he's nothing like the dentist referenced here."
935,"This is the absolute worst place ever.   I had a stroke from two aneurysms 10 months after having my daughter. Now, four years later I am pregnant with my second child. We had not planned on getting pregnant, but ultimately we are very excited. With that being said, I am a high-risk pregnancy.
I have now been to their office on four different occasions. They are completely ripping people off.
To start, I have waited for over an hour on two of the four occasions just to even be brought back. On another occasion I had to leave because I had been there for over an hour and there were still 2 to 3 people in front of me.
The first doctors visit, when I was only 12 weeks pregnant, the doctor recommended termination with zero reason or cause. Just simply because I had had two aneurysms that have been coil and clipped. Let me restate, he said ""ideally you would terminate this pregnancy, we would get brain scans to make sure everything is still OK, then you could get pregnant again"". He said this not once, but three different times.
Now onto the even more ridiculous part, they do nothing but give you a basic ultrasound and the doctor comes in and spurts nonsense at you. My regular OB is far more detailed and professional and knowledgeable. Then onto the bill, I just received a bill in January for over $1,700. For a basic ultra sound and less than 5 minutes with the doctor. That is after my insurance pays their portion. I should further state that I have Blue Cross Blue Shield PPO. Almost everything on the bill was made up. When I argued it with them they said it's all correct and factual. I work for a very large, very well respected company here in Atlanta. I have premium insurance. Is this a joke?? My next bill in February is for over $1000. Again this is just my responsibility, not to mention what my insurance is paying. Again, I had a basic ultrasound and 5 to 10 minutes with the doctor. If this is not resolved I will be turning them into BCBS for investigation of insurance fraud."
936,"Outrageous charges for a first time visit to have a RN do a wellness check that our pediatrician had just done the week prior but at 10x's the cost!  It seems like they are just out for the money and are price gouging (NICU) parents who are wanting to do the best for their children.   Our appointment was made by a caseworker at the NICU to make sure our preemie was on track. 
I'm not sure how our first and most likely only visit even helped our child. No real evaluation was made to see how he was developing. They spent maybe 20 minutes with us, weighed our son, took his height and measured his head. Then talked to us about how he was eating and Timmy time - that's it. That's what our pediatrician is for, I  don't need to pay a ""specialist"" to do the exact same thing. What services are they even providing?! 


The receptionist was also unfriendly and acted annoyed the entire time. If you've been scheduled an initial visit by a casework at the NICU, do your research first and call to confirm they'll be using a doctor within your insurance network. This is the most expense visit with a NURSE, I've ever had! Confirm what they'll be charging up front."
937,"If I could give this dental office 0 stars I would. As I read the other reviews on this site and their experiences, I question the authenticity of them.
I was given an estimate of $2600-$3000 for cavities I didn't have and a night guard I didn't need. 

I saw another dentist for a second opinion and yes, I had a few cavities but not as many as they claimed. ""You don't grind your teeth at night"", he said after I asked about the necessity of the night guard. 2 strikes for Your Oviedo Dentist.  My bill after my $50 deductible and cavity copay was under $150. So much for that $3000 estimate.  But best of all? My new dentist said, ""You're definitely due for a cleaning."" I told him I had just had one at Your Oviedo Dentist a few weeks ago and he scraped my teeth to prove to me that there was still a ton on tartar at the gum line. 

So, if you find yourself in this blood sucking position, do yourself a favor and get a second opinion-or better yet, avoid this place in the first place. I am furious and feel very, very taken advantage of!"
938,"One star for the awesome receptionist. Came here after being referred by a nurse at work. Went to the health room at work due to back problems. Nurse took my vitals and informed me that I had hbp and fever. She gave me Tylenol to control my fever and told me to visit urgent care after work just to make sure everything was okay since it's going to take a while if I would have to schedule an appointment with my primary care because of the holiday. 

I hate hospitals. I rarely visit my doctor because most of the times I get sick, I can control it. And also because I just have really bad experiences with doctors. For example, I've seen 3 obgyns regarding my menstrual irregularity and all 3 had different diagnosis. 

Anyways, I debated about visiting urgent care but I trusted the nurse at work. I didn't really care about the fever or hbp because they're controllable. I was just worried about my back. I've had back problems in the past but It wasn't as bad as this current one. So basically I've been in pain for nearly a whole month. My awesome doctor asked me a couple of yes or no questions, clicked some stuff on the computer and diagnosed me with sprain to the lower back. And this was all done without any examinations. 

I guess what I'm disappointed about is that, I wasted my time. Earlier that day, my co worker, who has absolutely no medical education, diagnosed me with the same thing using process of elimination AND web md :) (im definitely going to refer her for a job at that clinic) I was hoping for a definite answer or at least some exams, an x ray or something just to try and see exactly what is going on instead of just an assumption based on a couple of yes or no questions. Oh and when I told my awesome doctor about a fever I had earlier, he discredited my nurse at work saying she might not know what a fever is. Disgrace. 

Just a tip for anyone reading this. Always  research the doctor and the clinic before visiting. Lesson learned. Never again."
939,"It's simple: DR. BUCHANAN GAVE ME BACK MY LIFE! Over the past 3 years, he has performed 3 surgeries for/on me. I have been suffering from very debilitating CRPS in my legs since the age of 13. I came to him in horrible shape: big, oozing blisters down my shins, purple/black/red mottling from my knees down, practically bed-bound & on a walker. CRPS had taken over my entire life. The first surgery was the removal of a paddle lead that I had placed via laminectomy for a spinal cord stimulator 11yrs prior. Backing up: the first lead was misplaced inside my spine, so the stimulator did not work. I was told that having it removed would result in paralysis, etc. & I could never have another stimulator. This was a devastating blow, b/c it had helped so much during the trial. Fast forward: science advanced & w/ Dr. Buchanan's magnificently talented hands, he successfully removed that lead from my spine & I became a candidate for a new spinal cord stimulator!! Dr. Buchanan also performed the new stimulator implant & laminectomy. Long story short: I now have a successful spinal cord stimulator that works in both of my legs!! Dr. Buchanan gave me the use of my legs back!! (Did I mention I'm off the walker?!) I
have also had an internal Baclofen pump for severe/intense leg spasms since I was 19. Upon the 7-year pump battery change date, I had scheduled the surgery through my pain management clinic. It was on the books for months until 2 days before the surgery date, when they cancelled it (another story). Now, I had 2 months before my battery ran out completely (& was already in withdrawal). When I was able to see Dr. Buchanan, & his PA Rachel, the next month I was in bad shape. 2 days after my appt, the now *emergent* surgery was done! (& insurance paid in full!!) Dr. Buchanan & Rachel took absolutely amazing care of me (as per usual), & the surgery went off w/o a hitch! I have to say, throughout my many years of dealing with this horrible chronic pain, I have seen my fair share of doctors, & Dr. Buchanan will always remain at the very top of my list & have a large place in my heart. He is compassionate, knowledgeable, professional & a brilliant surgeon!! Dr. Buchanan & Rachel treat you as a person, not just another ""case."" They always listen, never rush me, & make a point to make sure all of my needs have been met. I am forever grateful to them both & highly recommend them for care. Thank you again, Dr. Buchanan, from the bottom of my heart, for devoting yourself to your patients & the care you give!! You've given me the use of my legs back, & forever enhanced my life!!"
940,"I thought this practice was top of the line. Dr. Molly Clark and Dr. Nelson are wonderful and I owe both credit for delivering my son, and saving me after an ectopic pregnancy. Dr. Marguiles and Dr. Portnoy should have their licenses revoked. I would have died if I listened to Dr. Marguiles after I started to hemorrhage after delivering my son. She said I should not overreact and put my feet up. I ended up needing a blood transfusion and a D&C to stop the bleeding and was on the verge of cardiac arrest. This week I had my left tube removed because Dr.Nelson identified an ectopic pregnancy that ruptured. She was wonderful! The next morning Dr.Portnoy came to check on me and had the worst bedside manner I have ever experienced. Cold, condescending, and no empathy whatsoever. She didn't recognize that I lost a wanted pregnancy and fetus. She actually yelled at me after I requested documentation for my employer. I think the ratio of caring and committed doctors vs the money-hungry ones is getting less favorable at this place."
941,"I was recently referred to Dr Osgood for a rheumatology work up by my PCP at Steiner Ranch Primary Care.  I read up on Dr Osgood, was encouraged by his background and reviews and called to make my appointment.  For the first time in my life, I was told that I could not be seen because I would be paying out of pocket. I am a well-educated, successful, self-employed professional.   I have been paying my medical expenses out of pocket for over a decade because I can.  

I have worked very hard to earn a life that includes opened doors.  I enjoy giving back to my community and passing on good values to my kids. I have never been turned down for a service at ANY establishment, medical or otherwise.  It is truly an awful feeling and it is personal.   It *almost* makes me laugh to remember being escorted past the public line at the White House, yet now I'm hard up to find a doctor at this clinic to find me worthy of their services.  I assume that by denying out-of-pocket patients, they are attempting to isolate their services to a certain demographic; or, more specifically, to keep another demographic out.  There are other excellent rheumatologists in the Austin area. I strongly recommend patronizing one that better serves our community at large."
942,"This place doesn't care about the patient, just not willing to help the patient. 

The appointment they could give to me was 3 months later even I have told them how bad my skin was and how miserable I was feeling. 

OK, I waited for 3 months. I had an appointment in the afternoon, in the morning, they called me said that the doctor would not be in the office on that day, and they need to reschedule. Lucilky, it was 1 week and a half later. Yes, I got an apology for the inconvenience. It was very hard for me to put up another 9 days under the skin condition. 

The doctor visit was @1:30 and it was nice. He prescribed the medicine and told me that if the insurance wouldn't pay for it, let him know, and he would give me another prescription. 
Before I left the office, I asked the front desk, if I had to call, which number would be the best number, so they gave me one. 

Later at CVS around 2:30, when I knew that the insurance wouldn't cover the ridiculous cost, I called the office right away. Someone on the line told me that he would pass the message to the doctor. 
Around 4 pm, I called back to check, and they told me that the doctor was gone for the day, and it was a Friday. And NO one passed my previous message to the doctor. 
There was no way they could reach out to the doctor after he left, and sorry that you have to wait till Monday. 

I really don't need that cold sorry. 
If any of them had a little sympathy, this would not happen. 

I will not recommend this place at all!!
I have never experienced any medical facilities like this in Boston!"
943,"It's been over two years since I took my then five-year-old son to this office for a cleaning and check-up. I'm actually signing up just to post this in hopes that it helps someone else. If all you care about is a fun waiting room, friendly front office staff, a clean office, and cool ways of keeping kids interested (prizes before leaving), yes, this office has all that. And both times we went we didn't have to wait long.

I was told that my son had two major cavities and needed caps on his teeth, and I reluctantly scheduled the procedure. I say reluctant because I was left asking the secretary what this procedure was and what to expect. Admittedly, I very much regret not throwing a huge stink and requiring better attention and explanation.

I still talk about the day of the procedure as one of the most horrific days of my life as a mother. The dentist was so unprofessional. My son wouldn't breathe the laughing gas in properly (not something he knows how to do), and she was clearly frustrated with him and impatient, and looking at me as if I should offer some sort of answer as to what to do in this case. Her assistants were talking about the partying they did the night before when the dentist left the room. Clearly this whole thing was taking up way too much of her time, and they ended up forcing the caps in while my son squirmed in panic underneath.

The worst part is that I had no idea that she was inserting metal caps on my sons teeth. I had no idea that for his childhood he'd smile and we'd see shiny silver caps. It infuriates me even to this day that anyone would alter a child's appearance like this and not mention it beforehand! I was told that they would be sensitive for a long time because it was so difficult FOR HER to put these things in. My son bled for over a year. In fact, he still bleeds two and half years later when he brushes his teeth near them sometimes.

After insurance, I believe this cost me over $800."
944,Poorly run business if it exists at all. Initially I reviewed their website and was excited to use several of their services. I tried calling to book appointments...no one EVER answers the phone. If you're an appt based business and you don't have a receptionist to actually book appointments you're business is doomed. What is the first thing you need to have a successful business...CUSTOMERS! Since my initial calls (yes multiple) the website has gone down. I drove past to see an empty parking lot...not surprising. I wouldn't be surprised if they are out of business.
945,"Not my best dental experience. The cleaning was fast, but felt complete. The exam answered my most pressing concern, but I felt like he was trying to talk me into getting more work done than I really needed. Not the first dentist to try that, but I still don't like it.
There was a bit of confusion with my insurance and I left not sure if I was getting excellent customer service or being taken advantage of. 
Overall, not a good fit for me, but I can see why others would have a good experience."
946,"It's all about what you want out of a dental experience. This place is the Ferrari of dentists, sparkling water in the lobby, overly clean environment, overly friendly people. But prepare to be told you need significant cosmetic dentisty measures. Dr. Sieverswhile nice and very knowledgeable will recommend you do things to the extreme. I went in new to town looking for a simple cleaning and checkup and I didn't even get the cleaning. On my first visit they took pictures and the doctor did an examination, I did not even get a cleaning. Two hours of my time wasted and all I received was an exam where I was told I'd need to have jaw surgery and significant cosmetic dentistry, I went to a different dentist today that cleaned my teeth and actually thought there was no actual need for jaw surgery or cosmetic work if I was happy with my appearance which I am. Be careful with Charles river dentistry they will upsell you hard,"
947,"This is a very long winded review, but I'm in shock how many good reviews this practice has after my continued disappointment in their unacceptable level of care.

I started going here initially for annual well woman exams, and I was just underwhelmed with the staff and process. Let's just say they didn't create an environment where I felt I could openly discuss all of my concerns. I brushed it off and returned for an IUD placement as well as my annual exam this year. Again, underwhelmed, and I felt like the doctor was in a hurry. She brushed off my concerns and was dismissive.

But that's not the reason for the 1 star review...

They called me with a FALSE POSITIVE genetic gene mutation result.

I decided to have genetic testing done because my mom and sister both tested positive for BRCA2 gene mutations. When I called to see if I could do this prior to my annual exam due in July, I was told I just needed to set up a lab appointment. I set up my lab appointment for 12/16/2019 and arrived to a lab tech who was confused on what I was having done. Confusion was partially cleared when she called someone to ""counsel"" with me as my primary doctor was out on maternity leave. She understood what I was wanting to test and took it from there. Fast forward to 01/13/2020 when I messaged to follow up on results. Turns out they hadn't been ran because my insurance was requiring prior genetic counseling. Myriad, the genetic testing lab, had reached out to this office 4 times before canceling the test because they hadn't heard back.

Luckily, the sample had not been discarded by Myriad, and I got set up with a genetic counselor (huge shout out to Informed DNA who did this over the phone and made me feel much more informed and at ease about the testing than Hill Country ever did). The genetic counselor explained in our appointment on 01/17/2020 that I met national guidelines and she would send my report to Hill Country as well as inform Myriad they could proceed with testing once insurance approved. She explained the testing typically takes a few weeks, but she would call me once she received a copy of the results to discuss everything further.

On Tuesday, 01/21/2020, someone from Hill Country called to tell me I was positive for the BRCA2 gene mutation. I remember thinking that 1) this is bizarre how non-chalantly someone is delivering this news and 2) that was a really quick turnaround time from what I was told to expect.

I reached out to my genetic counselor at Informed DNA who explained they had not received results yet. After confirming with the lab, Myriad, the test had not even been ran yet as they were still waiting on my insurance approval. She thinks what happened is they mistook the report saying I had a family positive for my own.

Overall a very emotionally draining experience that no one should ever have to go through. Thank goodness all of this has happened before my husband and I try to start having kids, so I can now find a different provider that I trust through that process."
948,"I am so glad that yelp provides the opportunity to share what a terrible experience this was with Camille watson. For so many years, i wondered how i would get the word out - I even considered taping flyers to the door of this office just to warn people to stay away from this place. It has been almost 7 years since my Lamictal-based health crisis. My experience is just like all the others - I went in for a light anti-anxiety med and went out with a script for 400 mg of Lamictal! I don't have bi-polar! Not only is Camille's personality not suited well for this profession, but she is grossly negligent. 400 mg of Lamictal turned me into a zombie and I still suffer adverse effects of this medicine even 7 years later. Lamictal withdrawal and long-term/permanent effects are well documented online. Stay away from this place! How does she still have a job here after all this bad press? It shows how the American health care system is more about the $ than helping patients."
949,"I went to Neurology, on referral to a new doctor after I moved from NYC. Took me 3 months to get an appointment. The doctor was dismissive and rude during my consultation. While they were taking my medical history, they said 'we understand from your notes that your Mother died of cancer, we're so sorry.' My mother is alive and well, so I corrected them. That didn't fill me full of confidence. In the end, I was so disappointed with the service and how I was treated by my doctor that I decided to find another hospital to manage my condition.

I paid my co-pay when I was at the hospital. Then, a month later, I got a bill for a second co-pay. After calling and being passed around from person to person and calling four different offices, it was eventually revealed that the hospital charges TWO co-pays, one for the doctor, one for use of the 'facility'. I have never experienced this at any other hospital in America. It was simply double the cost of any other hospital I have ever been to. Sheds light on why they have such a fancy building and a harpist in the lobby. I'd prefer they bill me for medical care, not dressing up their building to look like a 5 star hotel. They should be embarrassed. 

I am happily now a patient at St Elizabeth's and recommend them to anyone."
950,"I cannot begin to describe what an amazing physician, surgeon and person Dr. Walker is!  I had some very serious urogyn issues over the past two years (resulting from a bladder sling installed by someone else) that required several surgeries and/or in-office procedures and he has stood by me every step of the way, always committed to my satisfaction and health.  There are those who answer to a calling, and Dr. Walker is one of them...he was meant for this profession and is blessed with equal amounts of skill and compassion.  He is brilliant, yet very approachable, and you will more than likely call him your friend after being his patient.
 
Dr. Walker has the latest state-of-the-art equipment and technology/techniques available and treats his patients as if they were members of his own family.  He willingly takes the time to explain all treatment options, make recommendations, and supports you 100% in your choices.  I never feel rushed or judged when I have an appointment with him as he wants to ensure you have all the information you need to make informed decisions about your health.  I have never seen a doctor about female health issues who has his degree of patience, understanding and concern about avoiding unnecessary risks/pain and who will always treat you with respect.  Even after struggling with infertility for seven years before the birth of my twins, and believe me--there were LOTS of doctors--there was no one like Dr. Walker.

I am happy to say my health is now restored and I owe a thousand thanks to Dr. Walker for his commitment to making that happen."
951,"After moving and having a tattoo artist where I came from, and really feeling the need to get tattooed again, I started looking into shops in WA and OR. I really investigated for about a year and just kept coming back to electric boogaloo.  I decided to stop in and talk with the artists personally and get a feel for the place. I spoke to Jesse who truly is a people person. He listens, asks good questions and takes the time with clients and customers. He told me to check each artists books out and go onto instagram and look at all the work they had on there, see which artist style I liked the best. Im a fan of black and grey work, my daughter likes more color. So 2 totally different style likes. Jesse and Mikes work is phenomenal.  But being as I got an excellent vibe from jesse ( Mike didn't really talk to us either time there so I cannot comment on his people skills) I chose him. Both do excellent work in all areas. Not just specialized in traditional, black and grey, etc. 
The following day myself and my daughter went back to get our long awaited pieces done. Again. He took a lot of time with us. Made sure each drawing was precise and exactly what we wanted. During the session, he constantly checked in to make sure you were ok. Talked and laughed and joked. He has excellent skills and truly is fantastic at what he does. You don't feel awkward or out of place. It's like your among friends. I couldn't be more pleased with my work and will now always see jesse for my future pieces. My daughters work....truly there are no words that could explain the genuine awesomeness!!!! I thought her other work by another artist was awesome! This one by jesse is 100 times better. And that's saying a lot!  
If your thinking of getting a tattoo. Go in and talk with Jesse. You'll feel right at home in no time and walk out with a most fantastic piece you'll be proud to show off for ever. So suffice to say......we will be back next month :)"
952,"I had a wonderful experience at Texas Fertility Center. I have severe endometriosis (level 4) with a history of ovarian cysts, adhesions and scar tissue and had met with 2 other fertility specialists before seeing Dr. Kaylen Silverberg at TFC. Dr. Silverberg was the only doctor (including all my former gynecologists) to identify a septum in my uterus, which can cause late-term miscarriage. I had many, many pelvic ultrasounds before seeing him and no other doctor had noticed this abnormality. He was able to successfully remove the septum as well as pelvic adhesions and scar tissue from endometriosis via laparoscopy before we started fertility treatments. We did 2 IUI cycles and one IVF with TFC and I am now 16 weeks pregnant and we are expecting our first child in November. I truly don't think having a child would have been possible for me with out Dr. Silverberg's expertise and his incredible staff. Infertility/fertility treatments can be extremely painful and challenging- emotionally, physically and financially. Dr. Silverberg and his staff recognize this and are there to help with each step in the process. I was truly blown away not only by Dr. Silverberg's knowledge and expertise but also by his incredible compassion and kindness. I was honestly very sad to leave the practice after becoming pregnant (and I really like my OB!) It's a hard road for sure, but if you make TFC your ally in battling infertility you will not regret it."

954,"I never thought I'd leave a 5 star review for a dentist's office, but yet here I am.

Dr. Moser and her staff are so great at what they do! I'm usually anxious at the dentist, but they made every effort to make sure that I was comfortable. I, unfortunately, needed a lot of work done in a short amount of time and they had no problem fitting me in when my schedule allowed. 

Rena and the rest of the staff are super helpful and kind as well! They were informative and actually taught me a few things about dental hygiene too.

With a lot of work comes a lot of costs. The price of dental work can be overwhelming, especially with sub par or no insurance at all. My emotions got the best of me when I found out about the amount of work I needed and the price tag that comes with it. So I found myself- a grown 28 year old woman- sitting in the dentist's chair crying because I knew I would have trouble affording what I needed done. Dr. Moser was super understanding and Rena was kind enough to sit with me and cheer me up.  

Luckily, even the two women at the front counter (Corey and Susan??) were helpful and understanding of my situation and helped me with some financing options. I would definitely recommend this place to anyone looking for a new, caring dentist's office."
955,"First off, my significant other went here to get some teeth pulled. They didn't numb him enough and when he told the dentist. The hygienist straight up told him he wasn't in pain and that he was numb enough. Multiple times! I had to stop them and tell them that he needed more numbing. He was in a lot of pain and the dentist laughed multiple times. At the end he asked for a tooth brush and the man handed him a pink tooth brush and laughed. 

We were unimpressed and I was upset. I took note but later scheduled an appointment for myself due to the fact that they take my state insurance. Thankfully during my 1st visit the dentist and the assistant were really sweet to me. I was impressed and set up another appointment.

My second appointment didn't start out great, the dentist was incredibly rude, his hands were pinching the sides of my lips as he was doing the fillings. I had to tell him twice how he was hurting me, yet he continued to do it. Finally the assistant told him that he was still hurting me. 
He was sitting so closely to my head that his body was pressed on my face multiple times. And he put his tools on my chest as he was working. Not to mention he was more than rude to the assistant. (Who was a really sweet assistant and very nice.) 
I will never go back here because of this experience. I would have gotten up and left but by that point there were holes drilled into my teeth and I couldn't leave like that. No one wants to hear you being mean to the assistant, have your gut on my face, and leave with a busted lip from his rubbing, pinching, and pulling them when I told him it was hurting. (I will include the picture of my lip after I left) I would suggest going elsewhere."
956,"You're either going to get the most incompetent people on earth, or the best 5 star service from a hospital ever - no in between. I'm in the process of filing a complaint against an FNP who ""assisted"" me in the emergency room - the guy LAUGHED at my questions and told me to go home. When I told the assisting nurse that the FNP made me feel uncomfortable, he literally laughed. He blew it off and laughed. 

Most of the employees at the front triage area in the ER are the worst CSRs ever that shouldn't have jobs. They have absolutely zero empathy or communication skills, but fortunately for them, they are in the most secure field around. Don't go here. Die first before coming here. I'm sure you'd at least get better service in heaven or hell."
957,"Ok, so I tend to avoid dentists like the plague... I have one of those mouths that is just genetically, well, messed up.  No matter how much I brush or floss, bad things happen.  So, after about 2 years of avoiding the dentist, I decided to bite the bullet, figuratively speaking, and search for one.  Well, obviously Dr. Roxas has some serious swag on Yelp, so I checked them out.  The office is very comfortable and is a convenient location.  Upon walking in, I was immediately greeted by the receptionist Midge, with a big smile... not to mention, when I called and scheduled, I had a delightful conversation with said receptionist...  I don't remember my dental technician's name (sorry!), but she was so friendly, even as she was taking the x-rays of my mouth, never a comfortable situation.  Dr. Roxas was awesome, we made jokes and laughed... even as we discussed the serious and expensive dental work that was in store for me.  He also listened to my concerns and addressed all of my many questions.  He referred me to specialists for certain procedures (root canal), but I will no doubt be back for my regular dental procedures, as well as the crown that I need after said root canal.  Anyway, all in all, I will be a long time client at Dr. Roxas' office, this team is great!"
958,"I visted about 1-1/2 years ago, so this is long overdue, but I have to say something.  I went in with a broken tooth, which was causing me considerable pain, and was going through difficult financial times.  With this as a consideration, I told the dentist, who had recommended a root canal, that I would prefer to have it extracted.  He informed me that he would not recommend that and stormed out of the room, leaving his sweet nurse to explain to me that this was my ""meat-eating tooth, and I need my meat-eating tooth.""  I insisted on the extraction, and was scheduled to come in a few days later for the procedure.  Nothing more was explained with regard to what the procedure involved or what I should expect afterward.  I returned, and the procedure was long and difficult. The original dentist did not perform the procedure, and I am not sure that the individual who did (whom I had never met) was actually a dentist.  After the procedure I continued to experience severe pain.  No follow-up visit had been suggested or scheduled; but I made an appointment to return.  I had not been able to eat for days, had lost several pounds, and the individual who perfomed the procedure took a look at my wound and announced, loudly, that the problem was all the meat I was eating and laughed.  He prescribed more pain pills and antibiotics, and that was the last I heard from them.  These people were rude, unprofessional, and, in my opinion, downright dangerous.  I hate that I had to give one star.  I would not advise anybody to go here."
959,"Omg this place tried to rip me (and my insurance company) off! I went there thinking that it must be half-way decent and I was completely wrong. I went in for one thing and was told I had a whole wallet full of problems. It was just a consultation (thank god) but after it was all said and done, they told me that the total amount of work would be around 4k. WHAT? I went to another dentist that a friend recommended and he looked at the estimate and laughed. He said that not only was it wrong, but most of the stuff they recommended were procedures not even possible to do (scaling on my gums, etc.) RIP OFF. Stay away from this place!!!"
960,"I was nauseated and shooting hot chocolate out my rear end all day...so since this place has high ratings, I stopped in.

There was a man debating about being seen for his blood pressure and the medical assistant turned him away! 

When it was my turn, I asked about my symptoms but mentioned my blood pressure also (Due to a history of high pressure.) She said they don't treat ""high blood pressure"" and suggested the ER.

I wasn't pleased and cant rely on reviews in the future because the service I received (and witnessed) was horrible. 

The assistant made a joke as she checked in the next patient. She said, ""You here for high blood pressure too?"" and laughed. 

Not cool...."
961,"Only come here if you would like to get treated by Dr Ahmed who is incredibly condescending and rude. My wisdom teeth extractions became a 3 day nightmare where he had me keep coming back to remove teeth throughout those days. Absolute worst bedside manner. Would dribble my blood on my face during procedure and not clean it up. Had the nerve to tell me afterwards in a condescending tone that I should ""go clean my self up"". Before my precedure when I explained I fear the surgery he said he does it to 1 year olds and laughed. Currently sitting outside their locked office for my 630pm appointment and nobody is here (it is 6:35 now). Great assistants though (esp Hiedie). Feel bad they have to work under someone who talks down to them however."
962,"The facility is clean, the doctor was friendly and informative, and I was seen promptly.  There was almost no one here when I arrived which was good, because the telephone/receptionists made a mistake last month with my insurance. This needed to be corrected before I could see the doctor, and surprisingly, was handled promptly within 7 minutes.

I saw Dr. Thomas Sterne: 5 stars.
He also will call me with the results of my blood work for convenience.

I then saw a lab technician/nurse to have a routine blood draw. I jokingly said that I am a baby with needles. I sensed her tension go up an she insisted I lay down for the draw, just in case... I've never had a vasovagal response or feinted, but I complied. After I stood up, I pretended to start to feint, at which point she finally broke character and laughed.

It was childish of me, but hey, you're only as old as you feel.

I'll be back for my yearly preventative!"
963,"I spent the past 5 years in graduate school with no dental insurance.  Needless to say, once I started working I went to the dentist immediately.  I was a little concerned and frankly, embarrassed, that it had been so long.  The staff at Gentle Dental in Malden couldn't have been more friendly and less judgmental.  And I was right to go, I needed a lot of work.  Most worrisome were some scalings (root planning or deep cleaning) to remove years of tartar buildup.

A note on my first visit.  Dr. Payne was absolutely great, ironic name aside.  She was friendly, and did not chide me about my past dental care in the slightest...not that I had much control of that without insurance.  But back to the scaling.

Posts online say this is a painful procedure, leaving swelling, bleeding and generally requiring pain relievers.  The manager of Gentle Dental made me a bet.  If I hurt at all, I would have the procedure paid for.  I promised in return that if it didn't, I'd make a post here.  Obviously, she won much to the dismay of my wallet.

After the short-lived Novocaine wore off, I felt no pain.  I didn't even feel a bit of sensitivity.  During the procedure, Lisa, the hygienist, was talkative and friendly, keeping me relaxed and informing me of everything she was doing at the same time.  The Novocaine injections didn't even sting!

I have a few more procedures to go there (including wisdom teeth extraction...gulp!), but I'm honestly more excited to get everything back into shape and not the slightest bit worried about pain.  Can you say that about your dental provider?"
964,"I have been a patient of DR FIala for years, from breast aug to co2 laser this man is a genius. Recently, I decided to try Botox/Voluma injections with their new injection specialist Phi. Phi is wonderful! Not only is she thorough but had a much gentler touch than most I have encountered. As fillers are very much a art form my appts were scheduled two weeks apart so that we could do adjustments as needed to obtain the desired effect. I am very happy with my results and I have to disagree with one of the other reviews on bruising. I followed the pre and post instructions given to patients and had very minimal bruising. As far as pain of course there will be some discomfort ...you after all are having needles in you face but truly I would say not pain just a bit of discomfort. If you are looking for a amazing doctor who is not just caring but also has amazing vision and a staff that is not only competent but strives to give you a  informative and friendly experience then this is for you."
965,"I think people that give Dr. Budai (or the Clinic, in general) either a 5-star or a 1-star rating because of the professionalism of the team. I know that the previous sentence might sound odd, but please read on as I have been seeing Dr. Budai for over a decade and even followed him from his previous clinic to this one...and that's saying something when it's an extra half an hour drive for me! Also, for what it's worth, I've never had a problem with the online booking system nor with walk-ins. I've been to the office several times each year and can't recall ever having an issue with the site or any long wait times like many of the negative reviews seem to say happens O_o so I thought I'd write about my positive experiences.

I believe it is the professionalism of the office leads to either 5-star or 1-star ratings is because a professional doesn't tell you what you *want* to hear, but what you *need* to hear. The doctors of this group are not bullied or manipulated into prescribing medications that aren't needed and they ask the hard questions so that the right treatment is discovered. For complex issues does it happen within a single visit? Sometimes, quite reasonably, no - for the simple issues, yes, but some issues are not simple. For example, I had a skin issue inside my ears that was confounded with infections and ear wax and it took a few different ""try and see"" attempts before we arrived at the right treatment (a combination of washing technique and medication). But, the point worth highlighting, is that it *was* solved. I had been walking around with the issue for most of my life before I found a doctor willing to admit when he knew something and when he didn't; it has been my experience that most physicians, sadly, will speak as if they know something and prescribe some meds to conceal the symptoms rather than solve the problem.

I imagine that a lot of the 1-star ratings came from folks who wanted a magic pill to fix everything, when such a pill simply might not exist. I know that even I, myself, wanted some pill to resolve my ear issue and yet pills come with side effects and it didn't fully resolve the problem, so a solution that takes a bit more effort on my side (discovered with the help Dr. Budai) has proven to resolve all the issues without any side effects. For complex issues, sometimes the solutions aren't easy; many doctors will say that ""you deserve"" something easy, but the best doctors (like Dr. Budai and his colleagues) will tell you when it will be hard. No false promises here, just real solutions. For those who leave 1-star ratings, I would expect that they will continue to leave a 1-star rating at every doctor they go to see and who, predictably, cannot solve their problem...and then on to the next 1-star review, still with their health issue unresolved.

For me, finding a doctor who is honest and direct - even when I don't want to hear it - well, that's worth any delays in the waiting room or tough news that I don't want to hear. I mean, sometimes when I am with Dr. Budai or someone else on the team, *I* am the reason others are left waiting a few minutes because of the extra time the doctors at the clinic take to understand the root issue and heal me. I've had many doctors make me ""feel good"" with words at the end of visits, only for my health to deteriorate; these doctors make me be well with their medical skills."
966,"Although I've always been happy with my dermatologist, I'm disappointed that I never got a call regarding my last biopsy. What happened to being your patients advocate?
It is impossible to schedule an appointment! I was on hold twenty minutes and redirected back to the main menu three times, finally hung up. Honestly, by the time you actually might speak to someone that area on your skin you're worried about has truly become something to worry about.
Time to find another clinic."
967,"CareSpot's service and efficiency had me in, out, and on my way back to work in well under an hour. Even with an appointment at a primary care physician's office, this is a difficult feat to achieve. I was impressed!

Upon arrival, I answered questions via iPad about my health JUST ONCE. Simple questions sans diagram drawing or having to call relatives to determine health history. Such a relief compared to other offices and hospitals where patients are required to fill out tons of forms, all asking the same questions, making you feel like you're purchasing a home or you're on bad episode of Punk'd. 

The admitting staff was friendly and quite hilarious, which is refreshing when you're awaiting an ailment diagnosis.

The doctor had an excellent demeanor and explained things very clearly. I was pleased to find such a clean, friendly clinic so far away from home. Getting sick while traveling on the other side of the country for work is a major hassle and not an ideal situation. CareSpot made sure my situation sucked much less than it could have. I would definitely use them again."
968,"I read some online reviews of this doctor that said he was great, so I made an appointment.  

Office staff was efficient enough and nice enough at first (I called ten minutes before my appointment to tell them I was running five minutes late, but that I had downloaded the patient history forms already and filled them out so I would be ready when I got there ~ they only heard ""I'm running a few minutes late, but..."" and said ""That's fine!"" and hung up.), and facility was clean enough (despite the only bathroom being on the second floor, so had to make an elevator ride down to use it).  

But while waiting in the waiting room I could clearly hear the office staff talking to patients on the phone as well as each other about said patients.  I heard more than one name of a patient and what was wrong with them.  Isn't there a law against that?  Something called HIPPA?  

Despite feeling a little uneasy that maybe one day MY info would be broadcast to whoever was in the waiting room, I stayed.  And stayed and stayed and stayed.  My appointment was for ten ~ I waited over an hour.  I asked twice what was the holdup, thinking maybe an emergency had come in or something which would make the lateness completely understandable.  Nothing.  Staff had no idea why Dr. Meynig was running late or when he'd be in to see me.  They didn't even offer a little nicety like ""I'm sorry he's running late."" or ""Would you like something to drink?"" or ... hell, I don't know ... ANY kind of acknowledgement that maybe this was a tad exasperating for me.  

During my second inquiry, we heard a door opening and the doc coming out and they said, ""Well, there he is now.""  I looked around to see the doc and his other patients coming out, made eye contact with the doc and he said a cursory ""Hi"", then proceeded to walk past me to the staff, look at some papers, and say, ""Do you want me to talk to her now?""  Who?  ME?  The patient who's been waiting for an hour?  No ""I'm sorry I'm running late."" or even ""I'll be right with you.""  

Feeling invisible doesn't inspire much confidence, so I told them all that I'd make another appointment with another doctor and walked out.  When I called back to ask them to shred my paperwork, still no apology, explanation, small attempt to make me feel better and acknowledge what had just happened.  At this point, even an insincere apology would have been welcomed.

I understand some doctors spend extra time with their patients, asking questions, being thorough.  I like that.  Shows they care.  I'd gotten the idea from reading online that he was that way.  Great!  But schedule appropriately.  Don't cram so many appointments in the day that they're an hour late by TEN IN THE MORNING.  (Do people with four o'clock appointments have to wait 'til 7pm?)  And when you are running an hour late, at least offer some kind of small acknowledgement of it for crying out loud.  

I hope the reason for all this is that Dr. Meynig does spend extra time with is patients.  We need more doctors like that.  We DON'T need more doctors who think their time is so much more important than ours.  Waiting fifteen minutes to see a doctor?  Sure!  Twenty or thirty?  Okay.  Forty five minutes, especially when I was a few minutes late myself ~ probably.  But over an hour?  With no explanation, apology, comment, nothing?

When a person's sick, they need confidence and trust in their doctor.  They need to feel like they matter, like it matters to the doctor if they get well, like the doctor at least cares enough to give his best.  I felt like I was just another cash cow to make some money from.  

Last time it took me a few hours on the internet, researching, to find a doctor (add that to the wasted morning last Monday ~ thanks for wasting an entire day of mine, Dr. Meynig.).  I'm off to spend a few more hours finding another.  I hope this time it's worth it."

970,"My 8 year old son and I have had to take a specialized test to Mara twice.  These tests notoriously are ruined at the lab but Mara has been able to work through the 3rd party lab's requirements regarding insurance, the draw, shipping, and payment.  Both times, Mara did well with my kid and all the extra work required of these labs.  Mara is great!"
971,"went to this ER twice and each time the doctor would downplay the symptoms, prescribe pain meds and send me home. The place was also crowded and the wait was very long(hours...). So, don't go here if you are having an emergency. Both times I went there I go home just as sick but only with a huge bill to pay for terrible quality care. They only look at me and give me pain meds. If I wanted pain pills, I would have used the Advil in my medicine cabinet and saved thousands. I came here because I wanted them to fix the underlying issue. Throwing pills at me isn't helping. This hospital is very expensive but I wouldn't mind it that much if they actually helped me. It would actually be worth all that money if they helped me feel better. But, they didn't help me and now I wasted thousand of dollars that I should spend to get real help. I am going to search for different places to go because Mt Carmel could care less about the patients. I felt like I was a customer, not a patient this whole time. They just wanted the money. My health or life means nothing as long as they get paid. Anyways, I am sitting at home with the same symptoms and pain that I had when I walked in. I am also too poor to fill these prescriptions that was tossed at me. I am tired of people telling me that my pain isn't as bad as I know it is. If they are in my shoes and feel the way I feel, they would be singing another tune. This is my body! I know when something isn't right in my own body and yeah, something is wrong. But, nobody will listen to me. Apparently, strangers know my body more than I do. My blood will be on your hands if I were to die because of your neglect and laziness. And, that will be very sad because you are supposed to help people. They had the opportunity to treat me and help me. Yet, brushed what I am saying off like it is nothing. If it is nothing, THEN WHY AM I IN CONSTANT PAIN. You are a doctor, you are SUPPOSED TO HELP ME. Why would you work in the medical field if you don't care about others? Are all people seen as a paycheck to you? Do you only see dollar signs instead of people? Snap out of it! Real people are coming to this hospital and their lives are literally in your hands. Do you feel at all responsible? Do their health and lives mean anything to you? As a medical professional? I came to you for help and trusted that you would help me(even though my last visit here was bad). Is it my fault for coming here? For trusting the wrong hospital? This is the last time I would ever go to this ER. The doctors don't listen or care about their patients at all. I tried to tell the doctor my symptoms and even showed the list with all my symptoms written down. No matter how I go about it or what I say they would not listen to me. I am angry that I have a huge bill to pay for horrible service. I am mad that I am still very sick and nobody cares. I am typing this review to warn others and to help you improve this hospital. I hope that the owner reads this and make changes. Your staff needs to be retrained and they need to take their patients health more seriously(And, LISTEN to your patients when they talk). This isn't a Nintendo game, we don't have unlimited lives. You can't make a mistake resulting in someone's death and just restart from the last checkpoint. This is reality. There is no such thing as a checkpoint and this isn't a game."
972,"The good:
- Office was clean and I was taken on time

The bad:
- Cleaning was very painful. Maybe it was a better cleaning than I had received before, either way my mouth hasn't been so sore since braces
- I asked MULTIPLE times for the receptionist to check with my insurance and see what would be covered. I gave my information in advance so they could call, she said everything would be fine and covered. I stressed this very hard, I do not have enough money for expensive procedures. I left the office after paying a $50 copay. Ok... thats fine I guess. A month later I receive a bill for $130!!!! I made it VERY clear I did not want anything done that would not be covered by my insurance, and they lied to my face and cowardly hid behind a bill in the mail. I will not be returning to this office and I will pursue actions to refute this bill. It is NOT OK to lie to your customers, especially about money, and I urge you to not go to this office. Find someone you can trust (and leaving the office being able to chew solid food would be a bonus).

UPDATE (response to their response)
- As I said I am not complaining about the cleaning pain. Yes I did not have a cleaning for an extended period of time. HOWEVER they did just post personal information about my medical history on a public website which is far less than professional. 
- I understand how insurance works and I understand medical procedures can be billed in strange ways, but the fact of the matter is I left the office being told everything was covered and done at the $50 copay. This was a lie.  All I needed was a cleaning, they added on a comprehensive oral exam and x-rays, to which I agreed stating many times ""as long as it will be covered."" I walked into the office with very clear intentions of what I needed and they did extra procedures to be billed at 50% coverage. 

I did not write anything ""fraudulent"" nor did I wish to start a fight. With this review I simply hope to warn potential patients to be wary of the billing procedures when visiting this office because what I experienced was deceitful."
973,"Ackerman convert... here's my story...

Ackerman originally installed my entire alarm system (~$3,000).  3 years later, a touchscreen keypad failed completely... they charged me another ~$400 to replace this as it was apparently out of warranty.

13 months later the ""new/replacement"" touchscreen locked up.  I called Ackerman, explained the problem ... and they sent out a salesperson who tried to sell me a new service contract and (when I wouldn't buy) told me ""call service"" (which is what I thought I'd done the first time).  I called back and (after much running around) was told I'd need to pay $89 (for the first 30 minutes) to have someone come out to diagnose the problem.  The supervisor I talked to at this point told me the 12 month warranty had expired (4 weeks ago) so they couldn't help me out in any way and they couldn't give me any kind of estimated cost (not even a worst case scenario) without my first having to pay $89.

I then called AMSA (Alarm Monitoring Service of Atlanta) because I was damned if I was going to spend another dime with Ackerman.  The person I spoke to there (Daniel) very patiently explained that occasionally the touch screens can lock up and need to be rebooted by power cycling your system.  He talked me through exactly how to do that... and my screen now works again!  

So:

... after an hour on the phone with Ackerman and another 30 mintues fending off one of their sales reps - I was massively frustrated with a non-functional touchscreen.

... after 15 minutes on the phone with AMSA - zero frustration, system and screen are 100% working again... didn't cost me anything.  I switched my monitoring to AMSA and have had no issues for over 3 years!

I would recommend AMSA.

My advice, say as far away from Ackerman as you can.  I've never dealt with so many clueless/unhelpful people.  Their sales people have flat-out lied to me, I've had to deal with extremely unprofessional installers, and the only thing that's been consistent is  Ackerman's clear interest in raking in as much $$$ from me as they can."
974,"ONCE AGAIN......I am at the mercy of this ""place where no one cares""!! My pharmacy has sent 2 fax messages since ""LAST Thursday""....STILL no response. I have called, personally, and no response. If you are looking for a competent, caring medical staff...DO NOT look to Dr ""A'S"" staff. He is great, his staff?  HAHAHAHA! JOKE with no punch line."
975,"I was in the hospital for surgery on my shoulder and I awoke in a small, dark, windowless room - with no bathroom! I couldn't tell if it was day or night as there was no natural light whatsoever. I felt as if I'd been put into a stuffy broom closet. 

An hour or so after waking, I needed to relieve myself and I called for a nurse. There wasn't a bathroom, and I couldn't have walked to one if there had been - I wasn't strong enough - so I asked the nurse for a bedside commode. My doctor had told me that I might need one. She said no and told me that I needed to use a bedpan. I protested, but I was in too much pain and too helpless to do much. 

She brought me the bedpan and told me to lift my hips so that she could slide it beneath me. This took all of my strength as I was minus an arm and coming out of a surgery blackout. After much effort, she said it was in place and left.

Something wasn't right because as I started to go, the sheets started to get wet. I hadn't gone for hours and hours, so I couldn't stop. I'm an adult woman, and I soaked my sheets, my gown, and myself in hot stinky urine. It was awful.

I called for a nurse and the same woman returned. She was annoyed by my plight, as if I'd done it on purpose when, in fact the bedpan wasn't placed properly. She made a face and called for a friend, and together they got me out of my bed and changed the sheets. The nurse gave me a new gown and pulled my blankets around me, and that's when I remarked as politely as possible that my skin wasn't clean. I was polite because I was terrified she would leave me like that.

She tossed two packs of baby wipes on the bed and told me I could clean myself. Keep in mind, I had just gone through a major surgery and one of my arms was functionless. I protested, but she told me I'd be fine and she left. She left me sticky and stinking of urine, in pain and alone in a stagnant windowless room. All I could do was lay in my own filth and cry.

A few days went by in that awful room and I became more and more despondent. I felt like a prisoner and I slept as much as possible. When I awoke I'd have to ask if it was day or night. Every night, they cut off food service. After a while, I stopped trying to eat. The nursing staff responded by threatening to cut off my medication if I didn't eat a full meal. Days passed, and I still hadn't been washed.

A family member spoke up for me and got me moved to a room with a window for my last 24 hours. He made sure they washed me with wet washcloths. As soon as possible, he took me away from there.

That hospital was hell on earth. I filed a written complaint and received no response, not a word of apology.

Stay away from that place. If you must go, require a room with a window in advance and arrange for someone to check on you, someone close enough that you can tell them if you're being mistreated."
976,"My experience here has been more bad than good. The good: excellent nurses on the fourth floor. 

Day 1: First they didn't give me anything for pain when I woke up from surgery but insisted upon making me lay flat (and twisting my back to and fro) to take x-rays, then they didn't bring me tissues while I cried from the agony - leaving me there alone to blow my nose in my pillow and the nurse scolded me for removing my oxygen tube so I could blow my nose. Next, I couldn't see because they didn't clean the goop off of my eyes (they use it during surgery) so I had no idea where I was or who was around me - turned out there were plenty of nurses around but no one cared enough to check on me. 

Day 1: nurse gave me sips of gingerale. Even though it is written in my chart that I am allergic to aspartame and am lactose intolerant, the gingerale had aspartame in it.

Evening 1: they told me I could press the button every 8 minutes. Then the pain med button stopped working. I called for a nurse. 18 minutes later (I timed it) I called again. 20 minutes after the first call, a nurse who wasn't my own came in and said I'd reached my limit for the four-hour period. That made no sense but she left. 30 minutes after calling for help my nurse appeared and told me she had submitted a request to up my medication. 40 minutes after calling for help I was finally given something for pain. 

Night 1: I was given jello and applesauce for dinner. Unbeknownst to me, both had aspartame in them. I also had pudding but didn't want milk products. I declined to eat the lemon ice because it had aspartame listed as an ingredient. Severe migraine, stomach cramps and vomiting began in the middle of the night. 

Morning 2: I was told the Dilaudid was the cause of my migraine and vomiting and was given Zofran. For breakfast I was given more jello with aspartame. Headache, cramps and vomiting resumed. I started losing my vocabulary. I couldn't say what I was trying to say, called my pillows wooden boards and other items things they weren't. I started hallucinating and talking to people who weren't here. I couldn't tell the difference between a dream and reality. 

Day 2: asked for help to go to the bathroom. Waited 20 minutes and called again. Nurse said she was with another patient but didn't know why another nurse wasn't sent to help. Seemed like every time I ate I would get worse.

Evening 2: finally agreed to take 1/2 recommended dose of flexeril for stomach cramps. Nurse cut the wrong pill in half. Glad I caught that! She went home sick. Great. I hope she didn't leave germs in my room! 

Morning 3: still arguing over why I'm on a liquid diet! They sent me yogurt (a milk product I refused) so I almost ate the jello again but asked Peter to call the food service people to see if they had anything else. He found out on the phone that all of the food I had been consuming had aspartame in it. They had been poisoning me! So I ate fresh organic fruit from home. Thank goodness Peter brought it!

Day 3: the vomiting and stomach stopped when I stopped eating hospital food and declined flexeril and Zofran. I was actually able to stand up and walk. Still have a headache but feeling much better.  

Evening 3: Tonight I've asked to stop taking the IV Dilaudid. I hope to flush out all of the remaining poisons and hope the headache will go away.

Tomorrow: I've demanded to speak to the managers about the care I've received. I want assurances that their people will be trained on allergies, that all foods are labeled with ingredients so their patients aren't poisoned like I was. 

Friends don't let friends have surgery here."
977,"I was told to go to the ER for an emergency CT Scan. I get there around 2pm.  I didn't leave until 8pm.  I was given excuse after excuse as to why it was taking so long to be seen. Only 1 doc for triage.  I watched as the poor excuse for a patient advocate call security on a family of 3, which included a child, for asking a question. Once in back, I laid there on a bed for over an hour before someone told me what was going on, then another 45 minutes to be discharged, only after I called for a nurse.   Never again. I would take my chances at Grady."
978,"I have been coming here for about four months now maybe three I'm not sure around that. This place is clean organized and always looks great and they have lovely people that work there.This is a place I developed a relationship at.

So maybe the way I came off may have caused him to be rude, but regardless he was rude. When I finally told him what I wanted he said ok , and I change my mind because I saw it was the bottom of the jar. Then  proceeded to tell him I wanted something with better nugs because those look kind of crappy it was the bottom of the jar and that's not the kind of weed I like to buy.

980,"This business claims that they are ""gentle"" however they are not. It seems more like a warehouse factory than a place with doctors who care about you. All they want is more money out of you. I have gone to them for a few cleanings and that was okay but when something goes wrong, watch out. I recently had a cavity filled and was in pain ever since. I also had some piece of the filling placed in the wrong area and now it is visible on my front tooth. I decided to go back because I was in so much pain after getting this filling to see what went wrong. Dr. Kelleher said ""the xray seems fine, try switching to a sensitive toothpaste"". I did that, meanwhile I explained my symptoms that hot and cold anything on my front tooth hurt so much! That didn't help so I went back again and said I am still in pain. He said that I needed a root canal. I wasn't sure how everything went from being ""fine"" to ""you need a root canal."" I also asked if I had an infection and he said, ""no."" He didn't even prescribe me antibiotics when in fact a root canal is an infection! Their endodontist on staff prescribed me antibiotics after me telling her how much pain again I was in. The cavity was filled at the end of November, and it is now March and they also were not able to have an appt for me until March 27th!!!
Then..... I asked about what the cost would be. They said my insurance barely covered it and I would have to pay 595 for a root canal and then another 1,000 dollars for a cap, then 300 more for something else!!!  I said there was no way I could afford all that and they basically just looked at me. I said I wanted to get my xray for a second opinion and she said ""anywhere else you go will be more expensive."" 

I don't care about the price so much as opposed to the QUALITY of care. I went to this other endodontist who seemed to have a higher caliber of care. Wow! what a difference compared to Gentle Dental! He actually took time to let me know what he was doing during the procedure, put in the novicane gently (unlike gentle dental who just stabs it into your mouth), and he even called later that night after the procedure to see how I was doing. I also explained to their office how gentle dental claimed that I needed a cap or crown on my front tooth and they said, ""Front teeth do not always need crowns but can use permanent fillings"". Gentle Dental did not care about my financial situation, they just wanted to make as much money as possible!!! Well too bad for them, I went somewhere else and will never go back there again!

Also, I am not a person who skips cleanings, I go twice per year and get xrays. There is no way they should have missed anything if I did need a root canal. It was the initial cavities he claimed I had that I'm not sure I needed. The dentist opening it up, probably caused an infection and then yes I would need a root canal. Please be careful when choosing a dentist. I've definitely learned my lesson."
981,"I would give it no star if I could.  

The nurse and doctor both lied to me and said that it would have only cost $95 to treat the couple dark spots on my face.  After 2 weeks, the dark spots were still there so I went back.  And the doctor told me that he used the WRONG laser and needed to do it again.  And of course, they charged me another $95!  And the worst of all, the dark spots ARE still there after 3 months!

I tried to argue with them about the fact that not only I had to came back twice, but also was given the wrong information on pricing because the doctor used the wrong kind of laser for the first time.  But they just pointed out the fine print on the paperwork that I had signed during my first visit stating that i was acknowledged that it may take more than one visit. 

Avoid that place at all cost!"
982,"I first saw Dr. Thoreson about 16 years ago when my so-called ""Women's Endocrinologist"" told me there was ""nothing more she could do for me."" 

I have hypothyroidism and *thought* I was seeing a specialist - supposedly the ""best"" in her field. I was horrified when she literally turned me away. I had heard of Dr. Thoreson through a friend at work and decided to give him a try. He ran some tests that the Endocrinologist did not, pinpointed my problem, prescribed a supplemental medication and - I kid you not - within two days I was a new person.

He has a brilliant mind. I trust him implicitly."
983,"Waited over 45 minutes in the exam room before being seen. I was referred here from a hospital in North Portland, so the drive in itself was long enough. Can't really rate the doctors service though, as that STILL remains to be performed."
984,"I love Zoom+Care. I come to the clinic whenever anything is wrong. And I get frequent UTIs so, that's pretty much all the time. But I came to the East Burnside location and had Benjamin Baker treat me. 

He laughed at the fact that I get so many UTIs and then proceeded to tell me that he would not give me a vaginal exam because he is a man. He did not give me a choice. He did not ask if I would mind if he gave me an exam. He did not offer me any other options. He just said he would not be doing that. 

So, he just told me it's probably a yeast infection and he would be treating me for that. Finally, at the last minute, he asked if I would like to do a self-swap test. He fumbled for a while to get that ready for me and then awkwardly left the room and had the front desk person give me directions. I've done a self-swap test twice before and had no issues doing that. I did have an issue about how awkward he made the process though. He was clearly nervous and not willing to even look me in the eye or give me directions. Instead, he had the front desk person explain the process to me while he left the room. 

The doctor never gave me any comfort during the process but he did proceed to laugh nervously about the whole situation. I felt like the only adult in the clinic at that point and I was pretty upset by the whole experience. 

Baker had the worst bedside manner and I honestly don't think he should be treating women if he can't at least offer them some respect, comfort, and professionalism."
985,"I came here today for an ultrasound, and I cannot understand the 1-star reviews of this imaging center.
When you come here: brace yourself- it can be chaotically busy. Young, old, kids, whole families are in the waiting area. There are two locations for Greig's imaging, but you need to book in advance and be prepared to wait in most cases.
There are several parking spots in the back parking lot, and some metered and free street parking nearby. You should allow some time for parking, though I have never had a problem finding parking any time coming here.
It's at the busy intersection of Victoria Dr and E.41st- so lots of transit options close by.
I was surprised how upbeat and smiling front reception was - I would NOT be if I had to work here. Too many frowning, impatient and worried people sitting fuming, waiting to get their tests done ...

I was checked in quickly and efficiently and only had to wait about 10 minutes, thank goodness. The staff is very fast and efficient at getting people in, forms in, and processed- the pace is in here is fast and furious some days.
My technician was super friendly, very gentle and I could not have asked for better care during my procedure. She cheerfully showed me where to lie, which clothing to remove, and once it was done~ told me where the washroom was, so I could use it before the next test we had to complete.
Once we were done, she confirmed my family doctor would have the results in two days, and told me I was free to get dressed and leave.

Yes, it's super annoying to wait weeks for an appointment - only be kept waiting at the time of your booking,  but this health care today, unfortunately. Certainly is NOT any fault of the staff working here.
They appear to be open at 7:30 am -9 pm Mon thru Thursday, plus they are open on Saturdays- so their hours are VERY flexible for the working population to get their medical testing done.

Kudos to Greig Associates, and their staff for a job well done today."
986,"This dentists are wonderful , they are very professional. My 7 year old son had major teeth problem ,1st we took him to another family dentist and my son deny to get the treatment over there and also that 1st dentist gave me the shockingly expensive price to fix my son teeth even after using the insurance its still very very expensive. So that 1st dentist refer us to go to great grin kids , then we came to great grin kids, everybody was so nice and professional, dr.fariba mutschler were very nice and clear explaining to me whats going on with my son teeth and what they were going to do to fix it. And my son also feel so comfortable doing all those treatment , they are very quick and professional.im really thank god they fix my son teeth , now my son has healthy teeth.and whats best is the bill part, it was drop about 40% cheaper then the 1st dentist. Ohh my god we are just so happy with these dentist. For sure we will coming back and recommend them to anyone.thanks to doctor fariba and mark mutschler"
987,"I just went there for my first appointment there and they took 18 ex-rays of my teeth and then measured my gums, which I had never had anyone do before.  I was thinking that this was a good thing because they were going to clean my teeth based on specific needs of my teeth... that was not the case.  After about 30 minutes of the hygienist typing up a report, she shared the info with me and told me that I needed some gum cleaning and the recommended work was going to cost me about $700 after the insurance covered their part.  I told her that I didn't want any of that done and then she told me to walk with her up front to schedule my next appointment.  I was so confused... didn't I come here to get my teeth cleaned?  I asked the lady up front what I was scheduling the next appointment for and she said it was for the $700 work that I decided not to do... not a teeth cleaning.  I then got the hygienist back out and her why I wasn't getting my teeth cleaned and she explained that they had to do this $700 worth of work before I could get on the regular schedule of a cleaning every 6 months.  I then left and will never go back.  I have gone my whole life going to a dentist every 6 months and I have never had to do any ""deep gum cleaning.""  Why now would I need all of this work?  I just wanted to get my teeth cleaned and make sure I didn't have any cavities but all they wanted to do was make me and my insurance company pay a bunch of money for something that I really didn't need.  It seems like they are just salesmen trying to convince people that they need a lot more work than they really do.  I highly don't recommend going there if you want to just get your teeth cleaned.  I wouldn't be surprised if they try to convince everyone that they need this ""deep gum cleaning."""
988,"Can't schedule or keep their appointments at all. Leslie has been so unprofessional to deal with on the phone. I have had a microneedling appointment scheduled twice now (the first appointment was scheduled nearly a month out!) And have been canceled on the morning of the appointment both times, both times by confusing text message. 

 To boot, Leslie originally demanded that I text her my voucher code for the Groupon PRIOR to receiving the service, which is NEVER how that is supposed to work. I am very glad that I know better and did not comply, because this place seems like a straight up scam based on other reviews and my own experience. Hoping I can get my money back from Groupon!

I understand that ""shit happens"" but when you consistently cancel on your clients last minute, it's an issue with how you run the business. I was made to feel ridiculous for being upset, and the way communication has happened makes it hard for me to even trust that the technician is having the family emergency that Leslie claims. Everything feels shady and disingenuous."
989,"I first came here on suggestions from my co workers. Let me start out by saying I'm not giving them two stars because my visit there wasn't pleasant , because it was. I got my teeth cleaned there at my initial visit and everyone was very nice and helpful, or so I thought. I am giving this place two stars because they did not inform me that I wasn't quite in their network. I will take some blame in that I should have looked it up myself instead of relying on co workers, but once they told me how much a root canal would cost me I began to wonder. I have Delta Dental PPO and they take Delta Dental Premier. As simple as you would think it would be to tell me that, they never did. I found this very off putting. Also, I have asked time and again for them take me off of their mailing list and they have yet to do so even though I haven't been there in probably a year."
990,"I'm a newer patient (2016) but this review is well overdue. Everyone here is so kind, friendly, and understanding that I was genuinely surpised to see negative reviews of this place. I'll run thru some of my experiences at this office:

1. My first cleaning in years, performed by Ana who was so sweet and talked me through the whole thing. Turned out I had a few cavities so I had to come back for 2 subsequent visits which I was not happy about, but I figured if the dentist were anything like Ana I'd be fine.

2. I was so scared going into the office to get the cavities filled, but everyone cheered me on and assured me everything was gonna be okay. Dr. Bains' bedside manner was impressive and comforting. She was patient and talked me through the painful bits.

3. Second trip to finish off the fillings and I actually wasn't dreading it. I also picked up a night guard because I aggressively grind my teeth in my sleep. It cost a lot and tbh I'm still not convinced it's better than a pharmacy version but I try not to think about it too much haha.

I hope this review helps others who are thinking about coming here--you should do it! Also on a more practical note: the receptionist Karima is super kind and helpful in terms of scheduling. She even texts me instead of calling per my request"
